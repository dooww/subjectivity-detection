390,a baffling misfire,1
391,and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years .,1
392,it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .,1
393,reminiscent of david mamet's elaborate screen bluffs -- only livelier,1
394,more playful .,1
395,the cast,1
396,collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist,1
397,shows deft comic timing .,1
398,if you love motown music,1

403,and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles,1
404,and when joined by brosnan,1
405,the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing,1
406,'tis .,1
407,the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .,1
408,minority report is exactly what the title indicates,1
409,a report .,1
410,[reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .,1
411,inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out,1
412,but it's not that,1
413,it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners .,1
414,the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny,1
415,and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .,1
416,the most audacious,1
417,outrageous,1
418,sexually explicit,1

420,pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal .,1
421,one hour photo offers a very interesting snapshot of some decidedly modern pathologies -- suburban alienation and the illusions generated by the advent of the photographic image .,1
422,it showcases carvey's talent for voices,1
423,but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff .,1
424,it is best appreciated as an immersion in a three-dimensional toyland outfitted with enough whimsical gadgetry to fill a thousand playrooms .,1
425,children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated,1
426,and undoubtedly delighted .,1
427,the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .,1
428,nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .,1
429,the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength,1
430,but it's propelled by the acting .,1
431,"focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her "" madness "" so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device .",1
432,a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody,1
433,and to belong to somebody .,1
434,the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .,1
435,for all its technical virtuosity,1
436,the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .,1
437,a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times,1
438,but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism .,1
439,the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity,1
440,incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .,1
441,this slight slice of l . a . life is distinguished by two fine,1

445,'a fresh-faced,1
446,big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies,1
447,with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . ',1
448,making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it,1
449,though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror .,1
450,the film isn't especially dynamic,1
451,but it brims with insightful,1
452,poignant memories from survivors .,1
453,there's no denying how nice it is to see veteran actors bob hoskins,1
454,michael caine and helen mirren interacting with each other on screen .,1

460,a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake .,1
461,this is,1
462,not to put too fine a point on it,1
463,a swashbuckler,1
464,a costume drama . if you love that old story form,1
465,you will be in old-fogy heaven,1
466,as it is nearly a perfect example of a genre that died out years ago .,1
467,like to think of the film as local hero for kids,1
468,as the boy has to adapt from his urban kid lifestyle to the slow,1
469,simple ways of generations before . will he do it ? will it work out ? can love overcome ?,1
470,bisset still commands the screen as the graceful and outspoken frances .,1
471,for its seriousness,1
472,high literary aspirations and stunning acting,1
473,the film can only be applauded .,1
474,tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists,1
475,and in this film,1
476,every shot enhances the excellent performances .,1
477,lazy,1
478,miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .,1
479,the story that emerges has elements of romance,1
480,tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .,1
481,as underwater ghost stories go,1
482,below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back,1
483,grizzled and charred,1
484,somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle .,1
485,i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible !,1
486,in its understanding,1
487,often funny way,1
488,it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .,1
489,the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum,1
490,where viewers would be free to leave . immediately .,1
491,city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery .,1
492,there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .,1
493,the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character .,1
494,apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret,1
495,but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .,1
496,the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing,1
497,considering her inexperience and her subject matter .,1
498,stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge .,1
499,the movie is a little tired ,1
500,maybe the original inspiration has run its course .,1
501,though this film can be clumsy,1
502,its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .,1
503,being author wells' great-grandson,1
504,you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .,1
505,[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context,1
506,but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be .,1
507,deliriously funny,1
508,fast and loose,1
509,accessible to the uninitiated,1
510,and full of surprises,1
511,unlike his directorial efforts,1
512,la femme nikita and the professional,1
513,the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller .,1
514,it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .,1
515,the actors are all charged up by their roles,1
516,and it rubs off on us : you walk out with a caffeine- and-doughnut high .,1
517,naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work,1
518,on the other hand,1
519,may fall fast asleep .,1
520,it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns .,1
521,it's mildly amusing,1
522,but i certainly can't recommend it .,1
523,the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately,1
524,there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them,1
525,either .,1
526,much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization,1
527,haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation .,1
528,nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .,1
529,juliette binoche's sand is vivacious,1
530,but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .,1
531,the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys,1
532,whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting,1
533,writing or direction .,1
534,the film falls short on tension,1
535,eloquence,1
536,spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .,1
537,just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham,1
538,lots of cheese,1
539,with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half .,1
540,while this one gets off with a good natured warning,1
541,future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter,1
542,seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .,1

545,simone,1
546,andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire,1
547,has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it .,1
548,a morose little soap opera about three vapid,1
549,"insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those "" can this marriage be saved ? "" columns from ladies home journal . . .",1
550,the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist .,1
551,a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection,1
552,scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats .,1
553,speaking in terms of spectacle,1

555,romance and humor,1
556,it's the movie to beat this summer .,1
557,imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .,1
558,huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her,1
559,trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack .,1
560,too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .,1
561,there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry,1
562,and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia,1
563,the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch .,1
564,jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .,1
565,light the candles,1
566,bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply,1
567,and surprisingly,1
568,a nice,1
569,light treat .,1
570,"it's like a "" big chill "" reunion of the baader-meinhof gang",1

572,it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .,1
573,the fight scenes are fun,1
574,but it grows tedious .,1

576,typifies the pros and cons of the films that india churns out .,1
577,the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card .,1
578,pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer,1
579,his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical .,1
580,attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and,1
581,dare i say,1
582,outdated,1
583,it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .,1
584,those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .,1
585,"secretary "" is owned by its costars",1

591,the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema,1
592,only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .,1
593,impossible as it may sound,1
594,this film's heart is even more embracing than monty,1
595,if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .,1
596,this is one of jaglom's most accessible and genuinely enjoyable films .,1
597,the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments .,1
598,a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense,1
599,intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies,1
600,plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .,1
601,why sit through a crummy,1
602,wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies,1
603,when you could just rent those movies instead,1

610,but it's stupid .,1
611,the huskies are beautiful,1
612,the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .,1
613,as it stands,1
614,there's some fine sex onscreen,1
615,and some tense arguing,1
616,but not a whole lot more .,1
617,a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping,1
618,questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing,1
619,he becomes an enemy to his own race .,1
620,a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen,1
621,the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .,1
622,the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally .,1
623,there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television .,1
624,the boys' sparring,1
625,like the succession of blows dumped on guei,1
626,wears down the story's more cerebral,1
627,and likable,1
628,plot elements .,1
629,it's hard to say who might enjoy this,1
630,are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic,1
631,and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death,1
632,when the fire burns out,1

637,or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .,1
638,this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers .,1
639,like coming into a long-running,1
640,well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six .,1
641,there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .,1
642,no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess .,1
643,it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn,1

645,an uncluttered,1
646,resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations .,1
647,spider-man is about growing strange hairs,1
648,getting a more mature body,1
649,and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units .,1
650,what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts,1
651,as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .,1
652,although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television,1
653,music and stand-up comedy,1
654,this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless Â‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .,1
655,an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality .,1
656,'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . ',1
657,the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes,1

661,humorous,1
662,illuminating study of politics,1
663,power and social mobility .,1
664,we can see the wheels turning,1
665,and we might resent it sometimes,1
666,but this is still a nice little picture,1
667,made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer .,1
668,half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations,1
669,while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial .,1
670,narrative may be looser than baby teeth,1
671,but amy's orgasm is such a verbosely in-depth exploration of female sensuality and identity .,1
672,fails in making this character understandable,1
673,in getting under her skin,1
674,in exploring motivation . . . well before the end,1
675,the film grows as dull as its characters,1
676,about whose fate it is hard to care .,1
677,benefits from a strong performance from zhao,1
678,but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end .,1
679,as elegantly crafted as it often is,1
680,anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that,1
681,hampered by an undeveloped script,1
682,ultimately pulls up lame .,1
683,the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .,1
684,if you are into splatter movies,1
685,then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea .,1
686,dreamworks is to be commended for attempting to develop a form that,1

688,can only benefit from such tinkering .,1
689,the minor figures surrounding [bobby] . . . form a gritty urban mosaic .,1
690,it's not like having a real film of nijinsky,1
691,but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .,1
692,if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ),1
693,it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ,1
694,it's all bluster and clichÃ© .,1
695,showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro .,1
696,a droll,1
697,bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state .,1
698,[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy,1
699,and as the film grows to its finale,1
700,his little changes ring hollow .,1
701,da primeira seqÃ¼Ãªncia de luta Ã  piada que encerra a histÃ³ria,1
702,o espectador jamais desgruda os olhos da tela,1
703,saindo do cinema com a sensaÃ§Ã£o de que gastou bem seu dinheiro .,1
704,[smith] simply celebrates the universal desire to fashion our homes for our needs and desires .,1
705,the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism,1
706,but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .,1
707,there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ,1
708,when the explosions start,1
709,they fall to pieces .,1
710,a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a Â‘direct-to-video' release .,1
711,a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud,1
712,violent and mindless .,1
713,largely,1
714,this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .,1
715,as 'chick flicks' go,1
716,this one is pretty miserable,1
717,resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .,1
718,the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs,1
719,making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .,1
720,performances are potent,1
721,and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving .,1
722,peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further,1
723,richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination,1
724,no creature,1
725,no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery,1
726,twenty years later,1
727,e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone .,1
728,it's simply delightful to watch an actor like michel serrault do his stuff .,1
729,it's a humble effort,1
730,but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos,1
731,especially between morgan and redgrave .,1
732,for his first attempt at film noir,1
733,spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future .,1
734,the process of figuring out the moment the movie re-imagines the battle of the bulge with a bare-chested guardsman and a pike is more than worth the price of admission .,1
735,it looks good,1
736,but it is essentially empty .,1
737,this documentary by stacy peralta makes a convincing case on behalf of skateboarding,1
738,of all things,1
739,as a catalyst for this change,1
740,and for some delinquent youths in a derelict los angeles neighborhood as its agents .,1
741,the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of .,1
742,weirdly,1
743,broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end,1
744,after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .,1
745,this is mild-mannered,1
746,been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant,1
747,the outrageous .,1
748,by the time the surprise ending is revealed,1
749,interest cannot be revived .,1
750,directed in a flashy,1
751,empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name,1
752,becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .,1
753,it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss .,1
754,a work of the utmost subtlety and perception,1
755,it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler,1
756,who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy .,1
757,in their love for each other and their ability to move on,1
758,the women are,1
759,in a way,1
760,lovely and amazing .,1
761,not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks,1
762,college flicks,1
763,or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .,1
764,directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo,1
765,windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .,1
766,this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better .,1
767,delia,1
768,greta,1
769,and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world,1
770,miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking,1
771,flawed humanity .,1
772,what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete,1
773,if irritating,1
774,notion of class .,1
775,diaz,1
776,applegate,1
777,blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert,1
778,if not amused .,1
779,offers big,1
780,fat,1
781,dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah,1
782,what the hell .,1
783,the only way to tolerate this insipid,1
784,brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .,1
785,sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .,1
786,the story has its redundancies,1
787,and the young actors,1
788,not very experienced,1
789,are sometimes inexpressive .,1
790,that rare film whose real-life basis is,1
791,in fact,1
792,so interesting that no embellishment is needed .,1
793,it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful,1
794,all at once .,1
795,like schindler's list,1
796,the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent,1
797,but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .,1
798,this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre .,1
799,australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place .,1
800,tunney,1
801,brimming with coltish,1
802,neurotic energy,1
803,holds the screen like a true star .,1
804,a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .,1
805,insomnia is involving . still,1
806,i thought it could have been more .,1
807,that dogged good will of the parents and 'vain' jia's defoliation of ego,1
808,make the film touching despite some doldrums .,1
809,the film does a solid job of slowly,1
810,steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .,1
811,[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate,1
812,showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .,1
813,never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring,1
814,inventive and impressive .,1
815, . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .,1
816,the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo,1
817,but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking,1
818,quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose .,1
819, . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .,1
820, . . . more evocative than many other anime features,1
821,with its echoes of classic science fiction and contemporary cyberpunk .,1
822,there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness .,1
823,bollywood/hollywood is a happy,1
824,carefree trifle of a movie that is easy to savour because it is so undemanding yet so rewarding .,1
825,it's also curious to note that this film,1
826,like the similarly ill-timed antitrust,1
827,is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .,1
828,"even if you've seen "" stomp "" ( the stage show )",1
829,you still have to see this !,1
830,casting its gaze on painting masterworks and thousands of jewel-encrusted,1
831,elaborately costumed extras,1
832,russian ark is like nothing you've ever seen .,1
833,brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy,1
834,which makes its message resonate .,1
835,"time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool "" clockstoppers",1
836,""" but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .",1
837,no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek,1
838,the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .,1
839,warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people,1
840,relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film .,1
841,weaves a spell over you,1
842,with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .,1
843,has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together .,1
844,more entertaining than much of the big-studio schlock out there .,1
845,by the end,1
846,you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots,1
847,please !,1
848,i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .,1
849,a soggy,1
850,shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .,1
851,kidd deals with lust and egoism the way a surgeon is interested in a tumor . he exposes ugly attitudes but maintains compassion for his mean-spirited subject .,1
852,despite the long running time,1
853,"the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams "" bathroom break ! """,1
854,in an effort,1
855,i suspect,1
856,not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted,1
857,it offends by just being wishy-washy .,1
858, . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .,1
859,somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy .,1
860,it's everything you don't go to the movies for .,1
861,first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue,1
862,and the characters sound like real people .,1
863,ultimately,1
864,the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks,1
865,if you're up for that sort of thing .,1
866,spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average,1
867,showing signs of potential for the sequels,1
868,but not giving us much this time around .,1
869,unfortunately,1
870,neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .,1
871,chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .,1
872,the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest,1
873,but its just not a thrilling movie .,1
874,[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through .,1
875,it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense .,1
876,full of unforgiving irony and quiet realism,1
877,a song for martin stands as a powerful and moving achievement .,1
878,even with harris's strong effort,1
879,the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown .,1
880,while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller,1
881,it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem .,1
882," "" maid in manhattan "" is a charmer",1
883,"a pc "" pretty woman "" that ditches the odious prostitution theme for class commentary",1
884,mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded,1
885,as if circularity itself indicated profundity .,1
886,a generic international version of a typical american horror film .,1
887,even if britney spears is really cute,1
888,her movie is really bad .,1
889,every time you look,1
890,sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .,1
891,the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place,1
892,that time and that sport .,1
893,if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them,1
894,and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you,1
895,then you're at the right film .,1
896,it's bright,1
897,pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .,1
898,the longer one watches this determinedly ragged portrait of blue-collar teenage desperation . . . the more one gets absorbed in the utter unbridled nihilism of its 'characters . ',1
899,unfortunately this film will not satisfy if you are looking to discover the missing link,1
900,but if you are simply interested in humor and some 'interesting' footage,1
901,to say the least,1
902,you will not be disappointed .,1
903, . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .,1
904,it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed,1
905,but that's neither completely enlightening,1
906,nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness .,1
907,the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts,1
908,but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting .,1
909,it's pithy without being saccharine ,1
910,it's funny without ever not taking itself seriously ,1
911,it's full of beautiful characters and great performances .,1
912,unfortunately,1
913,as a writer,1
914,mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .,1
915,plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .,1
916," "" punch-drunk love "" is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . .",1
917,normally,1
918,rohmer's talky films fascinate me,1
919,but when he moves his setting to the past,1
920,and relies on a historical text,1
921,he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .,1
922,this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring .,1
923,morton is a great actress portraying a complex character,1
924,but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start .,1
925,the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible,1
926,but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them .,1
927,the plot mechanics of read my lips eventually kind of spin into a fairly conventional thriller,1
928,but the wildly talented cassel and the unconventionally alluring devos give this movie a unique feel .,1
929,pretty much sucks,1
930,but has a funny moment or two .,1
931,like a documentary version of fight club,1
932,shorn of social insight,1
933,intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .,1
934,what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness .,1
935,the main characters are simply named the husband,1
936,the wife and the kidnapper,1
937,emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .,1
938,it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company,1
939,not least as a self-conscious performer .,1
940,bravely explores the psychic damage inflicted on jean-luc by a withholding,1
941,then absent parent .,1
942,isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that .,1
943,like the tuck family themselves,1
944,this movie just goes on and on and on and on,1
945,it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood .,1
946,the chaotic lead characters are not the sorts one will usually see in a disney film and that makes for a certain amount of unpredictability before it all returns to business as usual .,1
947,the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .,1
948,jackass : the movie is a disgusting,1
949,repulsive,1
950,grotesque spectacle,1
951,but it's also hilarious and provocative . god help me,1
952,thumbs up .,1
953,a lyrical,1
954,bittersweet film about what could be termed a by-product of battle .,1
955,combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ?,1
956,stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness,1
957,wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .,1
958,you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky,1
959,but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .,1
960,you watch for that sense of openness,1
961,the little surprises .,1
962,an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see .,1
963,you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and,1
964,perhaps,1
965,give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .,1
966,stitch is a bad mannered,1
967,ugly and destructive little ,1
968, . no cute factor hereÂ… . not that i mind ugly ,1
969,the problem is he has no character,1
970,loveable or otherwise .,1
971,a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship .,1
972,so saccharine,1
973,i'm not sure i'd be able to take it under normal conditions .,1
974,worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance .,1
975,waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself .,1
976,with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood,1
977,windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .,1
978,hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality,1
979,suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema .,1
980,this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .,1
981,some elements of it really blow the big one,1
982,but other parts are decent .,1
983,behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art .,1
984,the story is timeless,1
985,but when adapted to the modern age,1
986,it makes for a wrenching film -- never preachy or sentimental,1
987,and refreshingly non-judgmental about the fundamental and contradictory issues it raises .,1
988,a stormy french adolescent drama about friendship,1
989,family,1
990,and sexual politics .,1
991,satin rouge is not a new,1
992,or inventive,1
993,journey,1
994,but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional,1
995,average,1
996,middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .,1
997,while the topic has grown heavier here,1
998,[moretti's] touch has not,1
999,and that disparity is precisely what gives the film its sustained poignancy .,1
1000,this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .,1
1001,deliberately and devotedly constructed,1
1002,far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect,1
1003,too neat and new pin-like,1
1004,too obviously a recreation to resonate .,1
1005,all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .,1
1006,the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .,1
1007,if the movie is finally stuck halfway been cinema and prose,1
1008,miller proves that it's not an unfertile place to linger .,1
1009,what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ?,1
1010,this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless,1
1011,idiotic,1
1012,annoying,1
1013,heavy-handed,1
1014,visually atrocious,1
1015,and often downright creepy .,1
1016,really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .,1
1017,the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic,1
1018,but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .,1
1019,as janice,1
1020,eileen walsh,1
1021,an engaging,1
1022,wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth,1
1023,infuses the movie with much of its slender,1
1024,glinting charm .,1
1025," "" 13 conversations about one thing "" is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling .",1
1026,as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character,1
1027,there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy,1
1028,clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .,1
1029,although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking,1
1030,the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey,1
1031,as violent,1
1032,profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen .,1
1033,aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai,1
1034,but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .,1
1035,doug liman,1
1036,the director of bourne,1
1037,directs the traffic well,1
1038,gets a nice wintry look from his locations,1
1039,absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere .,1
1040,heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension .,1
1041,tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard .,1
1042,even if you have no interest in the gang-infested,1
1043,east-vs . -west coast rap wars,1
1044,this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate .,1
1045,the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth .,1
1046,food for love endeavors and largely succeeds in lending equal weight to the emotional turmoil of its older and younger characters .,1
1047,it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia .,1
1048,so beautifully acted and directed,1
1049,it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses .,1
1050,old people will love this movie,1
1051,and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship .,1

1059,witty,1
1060,charming,1
1061,ultimately empathetic portrait of a once-upon-a-time industry titan .,1
1062,just a string of stale gags,1
1063,with no good inside dope,1
1064,and no particular bite .,1
1065,i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .,1
1066,there's an uneasy balance between the comedy and the drama that doesn't really fire on all levels,1
1067,but it works on a few of them .,1
1068,methodical,1
1069,measured,1
1070,and gently tedious in its comedy,1
1071,secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .,1
1072,the film is small in scope,1
1073,yet perfectly formed .,1
1074,lazy filmmaking,1
1075,with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling .,1
1076,the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .,1
1077,one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie .,1
1078,the man from elysian fields is a cold,1
1079,bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .,1
1080,once again,1
1081,director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .,1
1082,it lacks the compassion,1
1083,good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success .,1
1084,a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution .,1
1085,a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination .,1
1086,the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .,1
1087,the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star,1
1088,jean reno,1
1089,who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep .,1
1090,the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime,1
1091,and the fanatical excess built into it .,1
1092,depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply .,1
1093, with one exception,1
1094,every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big,1
1095,comforting jar of marmite,1
1096,to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness .,1
1097,you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .,1
1098,even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully,1
1099,this remains a film about something,1
1100,one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .,1
1101,the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees . i wanted more .,1
1102,excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama .,1
1103,light,1
1104,silly,1
1105,photographed with colour and depth,1
1106,and rather a good time .,1
1107,even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder,1
1108,however,1
1109,kilmer seems to be posing,1
1110,rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea .,1
1111,isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries .,1
1112,it's a shame that pokemon 4ever's dialogue is so trite and flatly delivered because the tale itself presents serious ideas worthy of more poetic language .,1
1113,poignant and moving,1
1114,a walk to remember is an inspirational love story,1
1115,capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter .,1
1116,always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .,1

1125,but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering .,1
1126,in its dry and forceful way,1
1127,it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land .,1
1128,ice cube,1
1129,as usual,1

1141,it is impossible to look away . ah yes,1
1142,and then there's the music . . .,1
1143,the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .,1
1144,one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .,1
1145,this isn't exactly profound cinema,1
1146,but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .,1
1147,the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it,1
1148,anyway -- maybe not to everybody,1
1149,but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right,1
1150,and then step wrong .,1
1151,what we have here isn't a disaster,1

1158,this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will .,1
1159,a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity,1
1160,but to help us clearly see the world of our making .,1
1161,martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender,1
1162,sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid .,1
1163,holofcener sees all of her characters as loving and amazing and she spreads the love to each .,1
1164,cacoyannis' vision is far less mature,1
1165,interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .,1
1166,reminds viewers of how beautiful and sexy a pregnant woman can be .,1
1167,the threat implied in the title pokÃ©mon 4ever is terrifying Â– like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .,1
1168,it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans,1
1169,but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow,1
1170,peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .,1
1171,it's a loathsome movie,1
1172,it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .,1
1173,"there are a couple of things that elevate "" glory "" above most of its ilk",1
1174,most notably the mere presence of duvall .,1
1175,it's clear why deuces wild,1
1176,which was shot two years ago,1
1177,has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf .,1
1178,this epic film,1
1179,eschewing dialogue and conventional narrative logic,1
1180,tells a gripping tale of biological drama through a highly improbable series of evocative images,1
1181,superb acting and editing,1
1182,and haunting music .,1
1183,a world in small,1
1184,subtly acknowledging larger economic and cultural forces one moment,1
1185,and in the next patiently observing the way a bowl of medicinal tea,1
1186,seen turning in a microwave carousel,1
1187,begins to describe its own slow epicycles .,1
1188,if you saw it on tv,1
1189,you'd probably turn it off,1
1190,convinced that you had already seen that movie .,1
1191,meticulously mounted,1
1192,exasperatingly well-behaved film,1
1193,which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .,1
1194,land,1
1195,people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored .,1
1196,an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .,1
1197,it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful,1
1198,self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful,1
1199,self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .,1
1200,it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over,1
1201,but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .,1
1202,truth to tell,1
1203,if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films,1
1204,there's nothing here you haven't seen before .,1
1205,why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?,1
1206,the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .,1
1207,the characters search for meaning in capricious,1
1208,even dangerous sexual urges . the irony is that the only selfless expression of love may be the failure to consummate it .,1
1209,this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one .,1
1210,by embracing the original series' tacky elements and inserting just enough self-mockery to avoid smugness,1
1211,the movie manages to fulfill basic expectations .,1
1212,turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts,1
1213,this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .,1
1214,i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .,1
1215,a mix of gritty realism,1
1216,crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in .,1
1217,with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on,1
1218,chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .,1
1219,[allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise .,1
1220,there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet,1
1221,it still works .,1
1222,in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter,1
1223,silberling also,1
1224,to a certain extent,1
1225,trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .,1
1226,an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time .,1
1227, . . . a cheap,1
1228,ludicrous attempt at serious horror .,1
1229,it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances,1
1230,from himself and from newcomer derek luke .,1
1231,adroit but finally a trifle flat,1
1232,mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way,1
1233,say,1
1234,jane campion might have done,1
1235,but at least it possesses some .,1
1236,nine queens is exactly the sort of film hollywood is always re-making and utterly ruining in the process . see it in this incarnation .,1
1237,so young,1
1238,so smart,1
1239,such talent,1
1240,such a wise ,1
1241, .,1
1242,the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do,1
1243,and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . .,1
1244,samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness,1
1245,although,1
1246,it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal,1
1247,it has a caffeinated,1
1248,sloppy brilliance,1
1249,sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care,1
1250,but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .,1
1251,the 70-year-old godard has become,1
1252,to judge from in praise of love,1
1253,the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .,1
1254,audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .,1
1255,one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once .,1
1256,take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema .,1
1257, . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal .,1
1258,quirky and understated office comedy with crispin glover as the guy who would prefer not to work,1
1259,but likes to hang around .,1
1260,such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .,1
1261,a sensitive,1
1262,modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china .,1
1263,visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .,1
1264,what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .,1
1265,exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength .,1
1266,the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification,1
1267,superficiality and silliness .,1
1268,an entertaining romp that stays true to the material's television roots,1
1269,this film is a good starting point for viewers unfamiliar with the series .,1
1270,somewhat blurred,1
1271,but kinnear's performance is razor sharp .,1
1272,by the standards of knucklehead swill,1
1273,the hot chick is pretty damned funny .,1
1274,quick pace,1
1275,no lulls,1
1276,many silly bits and a soundtrack that knows how to back this kind of satirical comedy,1
1277,'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates .,1
1278,punch-drunk love mostly feints and jabs ,1
1279,by anderson's standards it's strictly lightweight . but sandler delivers the kind of knockout performance that even his staunchest defenders probably didn't realize he had in him .,1
1280,were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good,1
1281,freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year .,1
1282,one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work .,1
1283,bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability .,1
1284,evelyn may be a weightless picture,1
1285,but it's hardly torture to sit through .,1
1286,bernal . . . gives an ambiguous performance ,1
1287,he's a lightweight actor,1
1288,but that's a positive quality when portraying a man on whom nothing leaves a permanent mark .,1
1289,it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison .,1
1290,testud is the burning center of a clinically dispassionate film .,1
1291,aside from minor tinkering,1
1292,this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994,1
1293,except that it looks even better .,1
1294,a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .,1
1295,frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it,1
1296,and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes .,1
1297,got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . .,1
1298,it's something of the ultimate scorsese film,1
1299,with all the stomach-turning violence,1
1300,colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas .,1
1301,this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .,1
1302,an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great Â‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller,1
1303,coupled with some arresting effects,1
1304,incandescent tones and stupendous performances,1
1305,together,1
1306,tok and o orchestrate a buoyant,1
1307,darkly funny dance of death . in the process,1
1308,they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema .,1
1309,a passable romantic comedy,1
1310,in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .,1
1311,this orange has some juice,1
1312,but it's far from fresh-squeezed .,1
1313,harris commands the screen,1
1314,using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness .,1
1315,an intricate tale of guilt,1
1316,grief and dark serendipity . . . so deft it's hard not to gasp with delight as the plot's pieces slide into place and its machinery begins humming .,1
1317,jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters,1
1318,one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .,1
1319,there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .,1
1320,this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you,1
1321,at its cluelessness,1
1322,at its idiocy,1
1323,at its utterly misplaced earnestness .,1
1324,bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .,1
1325,a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .,1
1326,by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it,1
1327,and,1
1328,of course,1
1329,feeling guilty for it . . . . then,1
1330,miracle of miracles,1
1331,the movie does a flip-flop .,1
1332,as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool,1
1333,you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .,1
1334,renee zellweger is amazing and richard gere brings a life to the screen that he hasn't in several years .,1
1335,angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca,1
1336,roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi,1
1337,and ruggero as the villainous,1
1338,lecherous police chief scarpia,1
1339,all sing beautifully and act adequately .,1
1340,the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh .,1
1341,nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget .,1
1342,playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant .,1
1343,'divertida,1
1344,enternecedora,1
1345,universal y profundamente sincera,1
1346,es una de las mejores comedias romÃ¡nticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . ',1
1347,an extremely funny,1
1348,ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china .,1
1349,it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ),1
1350,but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .,1
1351,for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers,1
1352,the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .,1
1353,what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .,1
1354,witty and often surprising,1
1355,a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .,1
1356,avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book .,1
1357,even people clueless about skateboarding can enjoy dogtown and z-boys .,1
1358,the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest .,1
1359,if this movie leaves you cool,1
1360,it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .,1
1361,this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance,1
1362,brought off with considerable wit .,1
1363,after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here,1
1364,it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen .,1
1365,likeable thanks to its cast,1
1366,its cuisine and its quirky tunes .,1
1367,the explosion essentially ruined -- or,1
1368,rather,1
1369,overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .,1
1370,essentially,1
1371,noyce just wants to tell a good story,1
1372,which he does .,1
1373,that a high-profile movie with big-name actors could inspire such philosophical reflection is impressive .,1
1374,not a bad choice here,1
1375,assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly .,1
1376,an indelible and ultimately moving vision of humanity buffeted by the elements and by international political tides .,1
1377,"stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a "" true story "" and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies .",1
1378,an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation .,1
1379,it's impossible to duplicate the shock of the 11-year-old lambs,1
1380,but the new film succeeds at creating nerve-tightening moments of suspense .,1
1381,collateral damage is,1
1382,despite its alleged provocation post-9/11,1
1383,an antique,1
1384,in the end . as are its star,1
1385,its attitude and its obliviousness .,1
1386,there's really only one good idea in this movie,1
1387,but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache .,1
1388,the smug,1
1389,oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive .,1
1390,if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version,1
1391,what would he say ? 'it looks good,1
1392,sonny,1
1393,but you missed the point . ',1
1394,it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .,1
1395,a much better documentary -- more revealing,1
1396,more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe .,1
1397,there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic,1
1398,and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version .,1
1399,a pleasant and engaging enough sit,1
1400,but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .,1
1401,with rare birds,1
1402,as with the shipping news before it,1
1403,an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion .,1
1404,makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes,1
1405,becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .,1
1406,a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .,1
1407,it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner,1
1408,and even if it's nonsense,1
1409,its claws dig surprisingly deep .,1
1410,for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s,1
1411,the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed .,1
1412,though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough,1
1413,around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .,1
1414,chilling,1
1415,well-acted,1
1416,and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer .,1
1417,sheridan is painfully bad,1
1418,a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .,1
1419,such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise,1
1420,you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .,1
1421,the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor .,1
1422,does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .,1
1423,"with "" ichi the killer """,1

1425,japan's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman . . .,1
1426,even with all those rough edges safely sanded down,1
1427,the american insomnia is still pretty darned good .,1
1428,nelson's intentions are good,1
1429,but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done .,1
1430,like the hugely successful first film,1
1431,the sequel provides pleasant,1
1432,engaging if largely disposable entertainment for the general audience .,1
1433,the moral is not too original,1
1434,but the offbeat characters certainly are .,1
1435,van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table,1
1436,but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats,1
1437,freddy got fingered,1
1438,and slackers .,1
1439,one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you,1
1440,with every scene,1
1441,that it could never really have happened this way .,1
1442,a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be .,1
1443,there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging,1
1444,life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .,1
1445,never engaging,1
1446,utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .,1
1447,one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou .,1
1448,it's unfortunate that wallace,1
1449,who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor,1
1450,has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .,1
1451,but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity .,1
1452,a directorial tour de force by bernard rose,1
1453,ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures .,1
1454,a disaster of a drama,1
1455,saved only by its winged assailants .,1
1456,features nonsensical and laughable plotting,1
1457,wooden performances,1
1458,ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .,1
1459,it recycles every clichÃ© about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .,1
1460,though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers,1
1461,it's exploitive without being insightful .,1
1462,director hoffman,1
1463,his writer and kline's agent should serve detention,1
1464,it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .,1
1465,it's the end of the world as metaphor for how we scuttle relationships,1
1466,and it's a remarkably apt one .,1
1467,the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems .,1
1468,84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also,1
1469,clearly,1
1470,great fun .,1
1471, . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps,1
1472,lots of chimps,1
1473,all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age .,1
1474,an unpleasant though sometimes effective psychological thriller that is noteworthy for being the film in which actress sandra bullock has gotten her act back together .,1
1475,this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .,1
1476,overall,1
1477,it's a very entertaining,1
1478,thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love .,1
1479,great trash,1
1480,one of those mediocre movies that in its own crass way is more enjoyable than most things that get nominated for oscars .,1
1481,an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world .,1
1482,limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very,1
1483,very slowly .,1
1484,two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .,1
1485,'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo,1
1486,manipulative sentimentality,1
1487,and sappy dialogue .,1
1488,this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .,1
1489,if you liked the 1982 film then,1
1490,you'll still like it now .,1
1491,martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more .,1
1492,evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .,1
1493,it's a weepy,1
1494,nail-biting story line that's all too familiar,1
1495,although abbass portrays her character with strong conviction and carries the film gracefully .,1
1496,a respectable venture on its own terms,1
1497,lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience .,1
1498,carefully crafted,1
1499,notably in its deft dramatic structuring,1
1500,and has become timely in a way its maker could never have anticipated .,1

1528,and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business .,1
1529,the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is,1
1530,but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood .,1
1531,a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director,1
1532,tom dey,1
1533,had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and,1
1534,for that matter,1
1535,shrek ) .,1
1536,leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller,1

1548,one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting,1

1583,a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic .,1
1584,it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .,1
1585,the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving,1
1586,and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy,1
1587,pretty and gifted,1
1588,it really won my heart .,1
1589,the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .,1
1590,to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers,1
1591,it will probably be a talky bore .,1
1592,if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy !,1
1593,a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls .,1
1594,the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot,1
1595,but so much naturalistic small talk,1
1596,delivered in almost muffled exchanges,1
1597,eventually has a lulling effect .,1

1604,in addition to the overcooked,1
1605,ham-fisted direction,1
1606,which has all the actors reaching for the back row,1
1607,the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .,1
1608,a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor,1
1609,sensuality,1
1610,and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys .,1

1628,i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .,1
1629,more intimate than spectacular,1
1630,e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny,1

1641,the script,1
1642,the gags,1

1644,and that's where this film should have remained .,1
1645,reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies .,1
1646,this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory,1
1647,and in spite of numerous minor flaws,1
1648,scorsese's best in more than a decade .,1
1649,an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch .,1
1650,if the last man were the last movie left on earth,1
1651,there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .,1
1652,the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .,1
1653,a compelling,1
1654,gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day .,1
1655,the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen .,1
1656,there's enough science to make it count as educational,1
1657,and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .,1
1658,smart and fun,1
1659,but far more witty than it is wise .,1
1660,going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film .,1

1662,dawdles and drags when it should pop ,1
1663,it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .,1
1664,it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .,1
1665,"it may not be "" last tango in paris "" but . . .",1
1666,there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .,1
1667,care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up,1
1668,but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .,1
1669,the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .,1
1670,a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .,1
1671,a psychological thriller that doesn't really hold up if you think about it too much,1
1672,but is nonetheless highly entertaining in a low-budget,1
1673,david lynch-ian way .,1
1674,part of the long,1
1675,noble tradition ( at least since the '90s ) of talky,1
1676,ensemble-driven american indies .,1
1677,this odd,1
1678,poetic road movie,1
1679,spiked by jolts of pop music,1
1680,pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress,1
1681,and to her inventive director,1
1682,that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .,1
1683,as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso,1
1684,sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast,1
1685,and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie,1
1686,no matter who runs them .,1
1687,although melodramatic and predictable,1
1688,this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love .,1
1689,for those with the stomach and stamina for its heartbeat-quickening intensity and body-slamming action,1
1690,rollerball delivers exactly what it promises : a people's hero you can really get behind .,1

1693,it is clearly a good thing .,1
1694,just about the best straight-up,1
1695,old-school horror film of the last 15 years .,1

1697,emotionally complex ensemble piece,1
1698,korean writer-director jeong jae-eun portrays this extraordinary turning point in every woman's life .,1
1699,dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .,1
1700, . . . a ho-hum affair,1
1701,always watchable yet hardly memorable .,1
1702,if you're like me,1
1703,a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat,1
1704,then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .,1
1705,slowly but surely devolves into a fascinating,1
1706,cringe-inducing portrait of cultural solipsism,1
1707,climaxing in an emotional meltdown that wouldn't look out of place in mid-period cassavetes .,1
1708,a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term .,1
1709,it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .,1
1710,scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .,1
1711,it's hard not to like a film that has sky divers jumping out of helicopters to catch flying dragons in a big net .,1
1712,none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .,1
1713,what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .,1
1714,this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .,1
1715,to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .,1
1716,this is a terrific character study,1
1717,a probe into the life of a complex man .,1
1718,plodding,1
1719,poorly written,1
1720,murky and weakly acted,1
1721,the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .,1
1722,it's mildly sentimental,1
1723,unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .,1
1724,a touching,1
1725,small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community .,1
1726,its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .,1
1727,just as moving,1
1728,uplifting and funny as ever .,1
1729,a little weak -- and it isn't that funny .,1
1730,as [the characters] get more depressed,1
1731,the story gets more tiresome,1
1732,especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .,1
1733,if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star,1
1734,then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago .,1
1735,so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .,1
1736,a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us .,1
1737,a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .,1
1738,quiet,1
1739,sexual,1
1740,disturbing,1
1741,often beautifully melancholic .,1
1742,the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . ',1
1743,the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?,1
1744,no way i can believe this load of junk .,1
1745,its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters,1
1746,but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .,1
1747,what the director can&#8217 ,1
1748,t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ,1
1749,s two personas interesting or worth caring about .,1
1750,[grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film,1
1751,and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle .,1
1752,renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable,1
1753,deeply absorbing .,1
1754,all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .,1
1755,what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising,1
1756,subtle turn at the midway point .,1
1757,the film is a contrivance,1
1758,as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence,1
1759,but it's an enjoyable one .,1
1760,the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .,1
1761,prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality,1
1762,jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment .,1
1763,carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders,1
1764,chan wades through putrid writing,1
1765,direction and timing with a smile that says,1
1766,'if i stay positive,1
1767,maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures,1
1768,drunken master . ',1
1769,this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces .,1
1770, . . . there's a choppy,1
1771,surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .,1
1772,riveting when it focuses on the challenges of crossing a generational divide .,1
1773,a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility .,1
1774,for the future,1
1775,one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band,1
1776,a professional screenwriter .,1
1777,the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems,1
1778,which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .,1
1779,with all the sympathy,1
1780,empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .,1
1781,a film of empty,1
1782,fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .,1
1783,viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess .,1
1784,jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness .,1
1785,has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .,1
1786,a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .,1
1787,it's their familial ups and downs that shift this small,1
1788,stubbornly poignant documentary . . . from the realm of special-interest audiences to the more universal theater of family psychodynamics .,1
1789,watching trouble every day,1
1790,at least if you don't know what's coming,1
1791,is like biting into what looks like a juicy,1
1792,delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .,1
1793,it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's .,1

1795,holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out,1
1796,in all its strange quirks .,1
1797,genuine movie magic . . . it transports you to a place somewhere between eavesdropping voyeur and silent referee .,1
1798,a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions,1
1799,writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .,1
1800,it picked me up,1
1801,swung me around,1
1802,and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film .,1
1803,despite the film's bizarre developments,1
1804,hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance,1
1805,unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity .,1
1806,it has something of the aura of four weddings and a funeral about it,1
1807,mixed in with a bit of bridget jones's diary,1
1808,but the movie's just too different,1
1809,too risky for huge popularity .,1
1810, . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web .,1
1811,a reasonably efficient mechanism,1
1812,but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .,1

1816,cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper,1
1817,cleaner camera lens .,1
1818,novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty,1
1819,no-budget approach .,1
1820,the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families,1
1821,but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .,1
1822,could use a little more humanity,1
1823,but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals .,1
1824,a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz,1
1825,spielberg knows how to tell us about people .,1
1826,the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .,1

1828,if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror,1
1829,this is your ticket .,1
1830,the off-center humor is a constant,1
1831,and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery .,1
1832,as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you,1
1833,this is f ,1

1843,like a fish that's lived too long,1
1844,austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .,1
1845,the sequel drops the adult aspects of the story in favor of talking reindeer and a life-size,1
1846,plastic santa replacement ( also played by allen ) that is strongly reminiscent of that creepy family from the duracell commercials .,1
1847,an unremarkable,1
1848,modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title .,1
1849,a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores .,1
1850,what emerges is not only an underdog v . simon bar sinister saga but a fascinating character study .,1
1851,mehta expertly fashions a fascinating hybrid that is sure to delight audiences with its good-natured and well-timed humor,1
1852,and its unabashed refusal to take itself seriously .,1
1853,adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary .,1
1854,the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites .,1

1856,clooney's a good director .,1
1857,the crime matters less than the characters,1
1858,although the filmmakers supply enough complications,1

1860,swimming isn't a major film . nor does it try to be . but what,1
1861,in the end,1
1862,is a major film ? if it's one that accomplishes what it sets out to do,1
1863,then we ought to correct ourselves .,1
1864,obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script .,1
1865,on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there .,1
1866,embarrassed myself about laughing out loud multiple times,1
1867,i found myself enjoying the movie much more than i ever enjoyed the tv show . . . and these pseudo-homo-erotic stunts .,1
1868,aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .,1
1869,part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy . tavernier's film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more .,1
1870, . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun .,1
1871,despite its faults,1
1872,this is a fascinating look at a subculture .,1
1873,less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .,1
1874,ultimately,1
1875,it ponders the reasons we need stories so much .,1
1876,the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ,1
1877,their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .,1
1878,an inexperienced director,1

1890,the movie keeps you diverted and best of all,1
1891,it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting .,1
1892,most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and,1
1893,no matter how broomfield dresses it up,1
1894,it tends to speculation,1
1895,conspiracy theories or,1
1896,at best,1
1897,circumstantial evidence .,1
1898,so muddled,1
1899,repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style .,1
1900,any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners,1
1901,poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .,1
1902,a tender,1
1903,witty,1
1904,captivating film about friendship,1
1905,love,1
1906,memory,1
1907,trust and loyalty .,1
1908,professionally speaking,1
1909,it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .,1

1911,often tender,1
1912,examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .,1
1913,ben affleck as jack ryan,1
1914,tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ?,1
1915,i basically went in expecting garbage,1
1916,but color me surprised when it actually turned out to be quite funny !,1
1917,the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries .,1
1918,turning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction . . . and the ring will never be more than a pretty good movie .,1
1919,formula 51 is pretty much quentin tarantino meets guy ritchie,1
1920,as directed by ronny yu . however,1
1921,if you like that sort of thing,1
1922,as i do,1
1923,you just might have some fun with the chemical imbalance of formula 51 .,1
1924,at once emotional and richly analytical,1
1925,the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose,1
1926,larky documentary .,1
1927,the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .,1
1928,i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .,1
1929,the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .,1
1930,an engaging documentary about people who live in unusual homes .,1
1931,kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick,1
1932,and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .,1
1933,a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .,1
1934,sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish,1
1935,and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .,1
1936,secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion .,1
1937,it proves quite compelling as an intense,1
1938,brooding character study .,1
1939,outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .,1
1940,though an important political documentary,1
1941,this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .,1
1942,everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting .,1
1943,those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective .,1
1944,swims in mediocrity,1
1945,sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .,1
1946,if you're part of her targeted audience,1
1947,you'll cheer . otherwise,1
1948,maybe .,1
1949,julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan .,1
1950,the problem with all of this : it's not really funny .,1
1951,not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh,1
1952,groan and hiss at .,1
1953,viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .,1
1954,as an actor's showcase,1
1955,hart's war has much to recommend it,1
1956,even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment,1
1957,the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .,1
1958,there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau .,1
1959,charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions .,1
1960,it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians,1
1961,another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective .,1
1962,for all its impressive craftsmanship,1
1963,and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos,1
1964,lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .,1
1965,unlike most anime,1
1966,whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes,1
1967,metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile .,1
1968,this is cruel,1
1969,misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .,1
1970,trailer park magnolia : too long,1
1971,too cutesy,1
1972,too sure of its own importance,1
1973,and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all .,1
1974,thoughtless,1
1975,random,1
1976,superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents,1
1977,de oliveira seems not only to have read john berger's famous essay on looking,1
1978,but also to have taken it as his personal instruction manual for filmmaking .,1
1979,a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .,1
1980,what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ?,1
1981,the exposition does pay off,1
1982,if you can stay awake that long . there's little gripping in the film until the second hour .,1
1983,lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is,1
1984,however,1
1985,a completely honest,1
1986,open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it .,1
1987,in his role of observer of the scene,1
1988,lawrence sounds whiny and defensive,1
1989,as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .,1
1990,a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino .,1
1991,philip k . dick must be turning in his grave,1
1992,along with my stomach .,1
1993,sillier,1
1994,cuter,1
1995,and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ),1
1996,but still a very good time at the cinema .,1
1997,hoffman spends a good deal of screen time alone and without much dialogue,1
1998,using only his considerable physical skill and screen presence to pull off the role .,1
1999,macbeth . mcdonald's . how far apart these poles of popular culture seemed until billy morrissette's sly mcshakespeare crime comedy .,1
2000,bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever,1

2004,in the pianist,1

2007,and he allows nothing to get in the way .,1
2008,romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .,1
2009,comes off more like a misdemeanor,1
2010,a flat,1
2011,unconvincing drama that never catches fire .,1
2012,the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence,1
2013,complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence,1
2014,but not a drop of human blood .,1
2015,first,1
2016,for a movie that tries to be smart,1
2017,it's kinda dumb . and second,1
2018,what's with all the shooting ?,1
2019,drumline is a movie that treats its characters and audience with respect ,1
2020,it can't be accused of being a dumbed-down teen comedy .,1
2021,whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy,1
2022,a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly,1
2023,this is surely what they'd look like .,1
2024,if you're willing to have fun with it,1
2025,you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful .,1
2026,not only a reminder of how they used to make movies,1
2027,but also how they sometimes still can be made .,1
2028,the main story . . . is compelling enough,1
2029,but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .,1
2030,[a] wonderfully loopy tale of love,1
2031,longing,1
2032,and voting .,1
2033,cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are,1
2034,with the drumming routines,1
2035,among the film's saving graces .,1
2036,winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic,1
2037,achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines,1
2038,precious circumstances and beautiful stars .,1
2039,culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf .,1
2040,it's not a film to be taken literally on any level,1
2041,but its focus always appears questionable .,1
2042,i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd .,1
2043,to my taste,1
2044,the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .,1
2045,adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .,1

2049,unambitious writing emerges in the movie,1
2050,using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .,1
2051,beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva,1
2052,the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller,1
2053,until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .,1
2054,it just goes to show,1
2055,an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .,1
2056,it's more enjoyable than i expected,1
2057,though,1
2058,and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .,1
2059,the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .,1
2060,the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .,1
2061,there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances .,1
2062,with youthful high spirits,1
2063,tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests,1
2064,and she is backed by a likable cast .,1
2065,despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .,1
2066,it's a drawling,1
2067,slobbering,1
2068,lovable run-on sentence of a film,1
2069,a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack .,1
2070,alas,1
2071,the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .,1
2072,a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .,1
2073,gangs,1
2074,despite the gravity of its subject matter,1
2075,is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .,1
2076,in other words,1
2077,it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus,1
2078,like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon !,1
2079,woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director,1
2080,"but how long will filmmakers copy the "" saving private ryan "" battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?",1
2081,the script isn't very good ,1

2084,ambition and accomplishment,1
2085,children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level .,1
2086, . . . too slow,1
2087,too boring,1
2088,and occasionally annoying .,1
2089,beautifully acted,1
2090,smart and funny . it steers clear of being a maudlin soap opera normally found on lifetime .,1
2091,in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ,1
2092,despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little .,1
2093,a bit of whimsically warped history elevated by the central performance of ian holm .,1
2094,it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years .,1
2095,a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown .,1
2096,it's a celebration of self-confidence and a slap in the face of a society that cherises impossibly unnatural physical perfection .,1
2097,the sweetest thing,1
2098,a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies,1
2099,may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view .,1
2100,instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western,1
2101,it's an unpretentious,1
2102,sociologically pointed slice of life .,1
2103,an absurdist comedy about alienation,1
2104,separation and loss .,1
2105,a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal .,1
2106,the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public,1
2107,to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .,1
2108,a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film .,1
2109,malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .,1
2110,one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .,1
2111,a profoundly moving document . . . the filmmakers' refusal to downplay the situation's intractability makes the glimmer of hope the film offers that much more powerful .,1
2112,the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .,1
2113,a sparkling cosmopolitan comedy that plays fast and loose with sacred cows of family values .,1
2114,there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about,1
2115,but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .,1
2116,an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't .,1
2117,[city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that,1
2118,' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year .,1
2119,not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe,1
2120,but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions .,1
2121,if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals,1
2122,it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .,1
2123,if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .,1
2124,it is a testament of quiet endurance,1
2125,of common concern,1
2126,of reconciled survival .,1
2127,it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring .,1
2128,it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .,1
2129,a tender and touching drama,1
2130,based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins,1
2131,reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .,1
2132,i admired it,1
2133,particularly that unexpected downer of an ending .,1

2142,but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .,1
2143,it's fun,1
2144,wispy,1

2146, . . . a vast adventure that bristles with romance,1
2147,action and heroism .,1
2148,it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo .,1
2149,one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces .,1

2254,has an impact that transcends politics and some dramatic overreaching by writer-director randall wallace .,1
2255,we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting,1
2256,their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .,1
2257,it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style .,1
2258,a colorful,1
2259,joyous celebration of life ,1
2260,a tapestry woven of romance,1
2261,dancing,1
2262,singing,1
2263,and unforgettable characters .,1
2264,a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties .,1
2265,birot has succeeded in making a movie that has some laughs,1
2266,low points and high ideals .,1
2267,writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . ',1
2268,the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed,1
2269,redolent of a thousand cliches,1
2270,and yet remains uniquely itself,1
2271,vibrant with originality .,1
2272, . . . [the film] works,1
2273,due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .,1
2274,even by dumb action-movie standards,1
2275,ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie .,1
2276,has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .,1
2277,nearly surreal,1
2278,dabbling in french,1
2279,this is no simple movie,1
2280,and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ),1
2281,creamy depth,1
2282,and ultimate theme .,1
2283,this isn't a terrible film by any means,1
2284,but it's also far from being a realized work .,1
2285,seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings,1
2286,stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore .,1
2287,the most impressive quality of this charming movie is the way the characters,1
2288,who are all recognizable 'types,1
2289,' refuse to behave the way we expect .,1
2290,even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director,1
2291,it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment,1
2292,i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again,1
2293,swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell .,1
2294,payami is to be applauded for taking biting potshots at such volatile issues as iran's outmoded electoral process and women's status as second-class citizens .,1
2295,hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size,1
2296,and it ain't pretty .,1
2297,a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack,1
2298,often overwrought and at times positively irritating,1
2299,the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself .,1
2300,sandler has played weirdos for zany comic effect,1
2301,and it's interesting to finally see him play one in a relatively subdued romantic dramedy .,1
2302,a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .,1
2303,talky,1
2304,artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise,1
2305,but a tedious picture .,1
2306,suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still,1
2307,as a visual treat,1
2308,the film is almost unsurpassed .,1
2309,it is depressing,1
2310,ruthlessly pained and depraved,1
2311,the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .,1
2312,a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises,1
2313,read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone,1
2314,but together they are magnificent .,1
2315,the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ,1
2316,others may find it baffling .,1
2317,oliver parker brings the wit's [oscar wilde] work to the screen in a solidly rendered creation .,1
2318,it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred,1
2319,puts a human face on it,1
2320,evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding .,1
2321,in the end,1
2322,the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived,1
2323,as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .,1
2324,a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards,1
2325,'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary .,1
2326,the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism,1
2327,"and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( "" laissez-passer "" ) wears its heart on its sleeve .",1
2328,the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield .,1
2329,it has the ability to offend and put off everyone,1
2330,but it holds you with its outrageousness .,1
2331,director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors,1
2332,and the costumes and sets are grand .,1
2333,a zippy,1
2334,enormously entertaining heist movie that,1
2335,with a kind heart at its core,1
2336,encompasses the styles of yesterday,1
2337,today,1
2338,and if we're lucky,1
2339,maybe even tomorrow .,1
2340,muccino is honest in the emotional damage left by his immature men and passionate in his portraits of twentysomething commitment-phobes struggling against growing up .,1
2341,you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles,1
2342,but it's worth yet another visit .,1
2343,with so many movies out there trying and failing to produce a single honest thrill,1
2344,it's so nice to see one come along that's packed from start to finish with 'em .,1
2345,a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love,1
2346,racial tension,1
2347,and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s .,1
2348,fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life .,1
2349,director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .,1
2350,a continually fascinating exploration of the physical and psychological pain and pleasure of a bizarre relationship .,1
2351,intriguing and beautiful film,1
2352,but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed .,1
2353,ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head,1
2354,but he knows how to pose madonna .,1
2355,often demented in a good way,1
2356,but it is an uneven film for the most part .,1
2357,bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising,1
2358,difficult and unbearably beautiful .,1
2359,the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush,1
2360,swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain .,1
2361,may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking,1
2362,but it is unwavering and arresting .,1
2363,charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom,1
2364,alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time .,1
2365,that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy,1
2366,sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .,1
2367,a worthy addition to the cinematic canon,1
2368,which,1
2369,at last count,1
2370,numbered 52 different versions .,1
2371,a movie just for friday fans,1
2372,critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing,1
2373,this is that sort of thing all over again .,1
2374,it is a timely film and a transporting one .,1
2375,highly irritating at first,1
2376,mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results .,1
2377,an overblown clunker full of bad jokes,1
2378,howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .,1
2379,death to smoochy is often very funny,1
2380,but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision .,1
2381,for all its alleged youthful fire,1
2382,xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns,1
2383,girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .,1
2384,sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick,1
2385,it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .,1
2386,as comedic spotlights go,1
2387,notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should .,1
2388,tavernier shows us,1
2389,in more ways than one,1
2390,that le cinÃ© ma de qualitÃ© lives on .,1
2391,it is a tough film to sit through,1
2392,not out of any violence or perversion,1
2393,but for its destitution .,1
2394,eventually moves and stirs you,1
2395,even if it often resembles those steamy mexican tv dramas/soap operas called telenovelas .,1
2396,feardotcom's thrills are all cheap,1
2397,but they mostly work .,1
2398,when a movie is as down-and-out funny as austin powers in goldmember,1
2399,it's easy to overlook the missed opportunities and fizzled jokes littering the barrage of hilarity .,1
2400,the importance of being earnest resonates and inspires rapid-fire bouts of laughter,1
2401,perhaps even a few giggles from the author himself,1
2402,whom posterity has rewarded the last laugh .,1
2403,in theory,1
2404,a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising,1
2405,but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .,1
2406,for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water,1
2407,snow,1
2408,flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again .,1
2409,chicago offers much colorful eye candy,1
2410,including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes,1
2411,hoofing and crooning with the best of them .,1
2412,like its parade of predecessors,1
2413,this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past,1
2414,and it doesn't want to .,1
2415,city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful,1
2416,conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .,1
2417,despite the film's shortcomings,1
2418,it's still a solid effort and a thought-provoking look at idealism gone wrong .,1
2419,a slick,1
2420,well-oiled machine,1
2421,exquisitely polished and upholstered .,1
2422,plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .,1
2423,funny,1
2424,somber,1
2425,absurd,1
2426,and,1
2427,finally,1
2428,achingly sad,1
2429,bartleby is a fine,1
2430,understated piece of filmmaking .,1
2431,an impressively coordinated enterprise that lasts three hours,1
2432,manages a large cast,1
2433,and covers a period of 30-odd years while successfully unfolding as a series of scenes from the life of a single character .,1
2434,it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .,1
2435,obviously,1
2436,a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential .,1
2437,the film might have been more satisfying if it had,1
2438,in fact,1
2439,been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .,1
2440,it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .,1
2441,all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .,1
2442,the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side .,1
2443,somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler,1
2444,there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .,1
2445,romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows,1
2446,but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here .,1
2447,ice age won't drop your jaw,1
2448,but it will warm your heart,1
2449,and i'm giving it a strong thumbs up .,1
2450,forget other scary movies with freaky internet sites,1
2451,dastardly murderers,1
2452,ghosts on boats,1
2453,spooky videotapes,1
2454,they aren't half as scary as a gothic good old horror film about monsters that live under the bed,1
2455,so earnest and well-meaning,1
2456,and so stocked with talent,1
2457,that you almost forget the sheer,1
2458,ponderous awfulness of its script .,1
2459,amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community,1
2460,one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger,1
2461,fatter heart than barbershop .,1
2462,the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed,1
2463,and kurys' direction is clever and insightful .,1
2464,the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive,1
2465,but that it's boring .,1
2466,a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers .,1
2467,not only is it hokey,1
2468,manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk,1
2469,but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches .,1
2470,notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights .,1
2471,with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles,1
2472,where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble,1
2473,the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas,1
2474,but it never manages to put them on the same path .,1
2475,the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long,1
2476,you're desperate for the evening to end .,1
2477,the three leads produce adequate performances,1
2478,but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .,1
2479,not exactly worth a drum roll but a movie with enough collegiate ka-boom to earn its title,1
2480,drumline is a percussion-driven musical variation on every sports pic you've seen about the talented hot dog who eventually learns to become a team player .,1
2481,though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director,1
2482,this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit,1
2483,with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .,1
2484,"this is not a retread of "" dead poets' society . """,1
2485,viewed on its own terms,1
2486,treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment,1
2487,but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic .,1
2488,as expected,1
2489,sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever,1
2490,though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances .,1
2491,static,1
2492,repetitive,1
2493,muddy and blurry,1
2494,hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .,1
2495,offers a fascinating look into the world of upper-echelon comics .,1
2496,would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . ',1
2497,this movie in a single breath goes to the very heart of the russian experience .,1
2498,one minute,1
2499,you think you're watching a serious actioner ,1
2500,the next,1
2501,it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in .,1
2502,it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .,1
2503,few films seem so wise and knowing about the fact of age and the approach of the end .,1
2504,it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film,1
2505,but very glum .,1
2506,[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence,1
2507,and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .,1
2508,vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ,1
2509,he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .,1
2510,that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy .,1
2511,offers 102 minutes of breezy,1
2512,occasionally very funny entertainment .,1
2513,absurdities and clichÃ©s accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel .,1
2514,this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker,1
2515,but good actors,1
2516,good poetry and good music help sustain it .,1
2517,a brain twister,1
2518,less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood,1
2519,success,1
2520,artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .,1
2521,the film's trailer also looked like crap,1
2522,so crap is what i was expecting .,1
2523," . . . although this idea is "" new "" the results are tired .",1
2524,one of the most incoherent features in recent memory .,1
2525,[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film,1
2526,which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .,1
2527,a haunting film about one of the great escapes of all time .,1
2528,beautiful,1
2529,angry and sad,1
2530,with a curious sick poetry,1
2531,as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes .,1
2532,it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful,1
2533,naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking .,1
2534,asia authors herself as anna battista,1
2535,an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy .,1
2536,the film is way too full of itself ,1
2537,it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way .,1
2538,this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams .,1
2539,can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still,1
2540,this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .,1
2541,proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts .,1
2542,the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .,1
2543,comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special,1
2544,freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears,1
2545,""" crossroads "" instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .",1
2546,cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material,1
2547,showing impressive control,1
2548,both visually and in the writing .,1
2549,i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings .,1
2550,although purportedly a study in modern alienation,1
2551,it's really little more than a particularly slanted,1
2552,gay s/m fantasy,1
2553,enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .,1
2554,there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .,1
2555,tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being .,1
2556,the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .,1
2557,several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare .,1
2558,an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .,1
2559,works as another uncompromisingly adult movie that assumes its audience is intelligent and doesn't have to cut narrative corners to make viewers feel safe .,1
2560,andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ,1
2561,absurd,1
2562,yet tremendously sad .,1
2563,merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen .,1
2564,much like robin williams,1
2565,death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .,1
2566,an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street .,1
2567,the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski,1
2568,made richer by his own experiences,1
2569,making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .,1
2570,the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .,1
2571,it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism .,1
2572,the powerless wait a long time for justice,1
2573,and sometimes their only justice is to finally tell their story .,1
2574,hoffman's unfettered performance beautifully captures wilson's sad,1
2575,manic quality .,1
2576,the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ?,1
2577,definitely funny stuff,1
2578,but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . ',1
2579,imamura's delight in the infinite oddity of men and women is goofy ,1
2580,it's also,1
2581,at heart,1
2582,reverent .,1
2583,one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love .,1
2584,combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters,1
2585,comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements,1
2586,and yet at the end,1
2587,we are undeniably touched .,1
2588,it's a fun movie with lots of colorful characters,1
2589,lots of bizarre plot meanderings and quite a few memorable lines and sequences .,1
2590,a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .,1
2591,it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy,1
2592,the films of fassbinder,1
2593,perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya .,1
2594,mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns .,1
2595,rock's got the kind of sly charm and non- self-conscious sincerity that could fit into any action hero archetype imaginable,1
2596,even the old-school ones .,1
2597,like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor .,1
2598,the real reason to see runteldat is to watch lawrence deploy his deep and wide powers of empathy to depict such diverse experiences as childbirth,1
2599,breast-feeding and recovering from illness .,1
2600,significant for the chilling moments when the children echo the very sentiments that continue to fuel the middle east conflict .,1
2601,the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .,1
2602,no number of fantastic sets,1
2603,extras,1
2604,costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .,1
2605,claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills,1
2606,but that's okay .,1
2607,even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment,1
2608,spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man .,1
2609,terrific as nadia,1
2610,a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english,1
2611,it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers .,1
2612,if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum,1
2613,her tough,1
2614,funny,1
2615,rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .,1
2616,despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life,1
2617,it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .,1
2618,even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog,1
2619,and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .,1
2620,the cast has a high time,1
2621,but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .,1
2622,windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop .,1
2623,those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know .,1
2624,it's enough to watch huppert scheming,1
2625,with her small,1
2626,intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain,1
2627,and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins .,1
2628,provides an intriguing look at how the new economy has redrawn class lines in contemporary china .,1
2629,austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck,1
2630,a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride .,1
2631,what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well,1
2632,it's not as pathetic as the animal .,1
2633,it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor .,1
2634,while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart,1
2635,""" in the bedroom",1
2636,""" moretti's film makes its own",1
2637,quieter observations,1
2638,kids surely will like it . and for adults,1
2639,it's perfectly watchable in a rugrats-y sort of way .,1
2640,a canny franchise escapade ,1
2641,it gets the job done .,1
2642,bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique,1
2643,entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal .,1
2644,the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda .,1
2645,hardly a masterpiece,1
2646,but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people .,1
2647,if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body,1
2648,a rumor of angels should dispel it .,1
2649, . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture,1
2650,the journey doesn't really go anywhere .,1
2651,a hilarious film for anyone who remembers lying as a kid -- and anyone who wants to see a movie that's just plain fun .,1
2652,with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action,1
2653,all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .,1
2654,while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film,1
2655,it's far from being this generation's animal house .,1
2656,such a good-looking picture deserved to have more depth and unpredictability in its story . but it does stand out as a personal and unique entry in a time-worn genre,1
2657,and that may be good enough .,1
2658,not a cozy or ingratiating work,1
2659,but it's challenging,1
2660,sometimes clever,1
2661,and always interesting,1
2662,and those are reasons enough to see it .,1
2663,k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories,1
2664,but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia .,1
2665,chilling in its objective portrait of dreary,1
2666,lost twenty-first century america .,1
2667,a spiritual exploration of sorts,1
2668,offering a message of hope that resonates .,1
2669,a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast,1
2670,but never quite gets off the ground .,1
2671,we started to wonder if Â… some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock,1
2672,' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine .,1
2673,goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures,1
2674,and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .,1
2675,this is a film living far too much in its own head .,1
2676,while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke,1
2677,he has at least one more story to tell : his own .,1
2678,it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . .,1
2679,a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship .,1
2680,[jaglom] creates an engaging insider's world of enthusiastically entertaining characters and absorbing situations .,1
2681,i don't think this movie loves women at all .,1
2682,short and sweet,1
2683,but also more than anything else slightÂ… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .,1
2684,i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops .,1
2685,it should be interesting,1
2686,it should be poignant,1
2687,it turns out to be affected and boring .,1
2688,the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance,1
2689,but twists are getting irritating,1
2690,and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .,1
2691,the words,1
2692,'frankly,1
2693,my dear,1
2694,i don't give a damn,1
2695,' have never been more appropriate .,1
2696,considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts,1
2697,this must have been a difficult shoot,1
2698,but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .,1
2699,well made but uninvolving,1
2700,bloodwork isn't a terrible movie,1
2701,just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .,1
2702,feels aimless for much of its running time,1
2703,until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives,1
2704,leaving questions in its wake .,1
2705,blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be,1
2706,but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth,1
2707,cruel as it may sound,1
2708,he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy .,1
2709,it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy,1
2710,a kind of elder bueller's time out .,1
2711,a determined,1
2712,ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .,1
2713,for those in search of something different,1
2714,wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .,1
2715,raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .,1
2716,this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works,1
2717,but also one of his most uncanny .,1
2718,because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them,1
2719,tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s,1
2720,the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions .,1
2721,certainly beautiful to look at,1
2722,but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .,1
2723,despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow,1
2724,the weight of water is oppressively heavy .,1
2725,by turns touching,1
2726,raucously amusing,1
2727,uncomfortable,1
2728,and,1
2729,yes,1
2730,even sexy,1
2731,never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre .,1
2732,disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .,1
2733,it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax .,1
2734, . . . a b-movie-and-proud-of-it thrill ride,1
2735,probably the best of its kind since tremors .,1
2736,the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .,1
2737,bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame,1
2738,making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough .,1
2739,son of the bride is slight fare,1
2740,but it does have it poignancies,1
2741,and it is well-acted and sweet without being cloying .,1
2742,the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed,1
2743,cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .,1
2744,a depressingly retrograde,1
2745,'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .,1
2746,neighbor's dog operates at a consistent chuckle pitch that frequently gives way to guffaws .,1
2747,slow and ponderous,1
2748,but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion,1
2749,sacrifice,1
2750,and christian love in the face of political corruption .,1
2751,those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi .,1
2752, . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric,1
2753,super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction .,1
2754,a raw comedy that is intermittently hilarious as it attacks pretty much every taboo around .,1
2755,bursting through the constraints of its source,1
2756,this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .,1
2757,scotland,1
2758,pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped .,1
2759,audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching,1
2760,but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .,1
2761,according to wendigo,1
2762,'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .,1
2763,the filmmaker ascends,1
2764,literally,1
2765,to the olympus of the art world,1
2766,but he would have done well to end this flawed,1
2767,dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .,1
2768,a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .,1
2769,it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep,1
2770,but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .,1
2771,despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even,1
2772,at times,1
2773,preposterous ) turns,1
2774,love is just too,1
2775,too precious in the end .,1
2776,haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed .,1
2777,a delicate balance of nostalgia and contemporary themes win out over scripting pregnant with cinematic schmaltz .,1
2778,proof that a newcomer indie filmmaker can infuse some new life into the downtrodden loser character study .,1
2779,curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary .,1
2780,even when he's not at his most critically insightful,1
2781,godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work .,1
2782,sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .,1
2783,the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing,1
2784,or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible !,1
2785,soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing .,1
2786,a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture .,1
2787,director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .,1
2788,thirty years ago,1
2789,it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired .,1
2790,gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up .,1
2791,there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs .,1
2792,others,1
2793,more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge',1
2794,or more willing to see with their own eyes,1
2795,will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .,1
2796,nemesis has a delightfully nasty villain and pumped-up action,1
2797,albeit along familiar lines .,1
2798,a sweet,1
2799,engaging family story about the nature of faith and the power of youthful innocence .,1
2800,it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .,1
2801,yes,1
2802,it's as good as you remember . in fact,1
2803,even better .,1
2804,take a friend ( invisible or real ) to see this one . . . it's laugh out loud funny,1
2805,with each of her three protagonists,1
2806,miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life,1
2807,out of a deep-seated,1
2808,emotional need,1
2809,is about to turn onto a different path .,1
2810,fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .,1
2811,a thoughtful,1
2812,reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture,1
2813,with its own rules regarding love and family,1
2814,governance and hierarchy .,1
2815,well-intentioned though it may be,1
2816,its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic,1
2817,preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .,1
2818,graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies .,1
2819,to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame,1
2820,reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw .,1
2821,it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie,1
2822,but it's entertaining enough and worth a look .,1
2823,for all its bile and incoherence,1
2824,in praise of love is filled with haunting images and insights . godard may be a lion in winter,1
2825,but the lion still roars .,1
2826, . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .,1
2827,[it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest .,1
2828,lacking gravitas,1
2829,macdowell is a placeholder for grief,1
2830,and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine .,1
2831,i can't imagine adaptation having much mainstream appeal,1
2832,but,1
2833,for those who look for something genuinely off-the-wall in a motion picture,1
2834,this will unquestionably strike a nerve .,1
2835, . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining,1
2836,despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . .,1
2837,a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family .,1
2838,thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories,1
2839,and,1
2840,like a mobius strip,1
2841,elliptically loops back to where it began .,1
2842,instead of making his own style,1
2843,director marcus adams just copies from various sources Â– good sources,1
2844,bad mixture,1
2845,although it tries to be much more,1
2846,it's really just another major league .,1
2847,so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time,1
2848,as far as movies are concerned .,1
2849,the director,1
2850,mark pellington,1
2851,does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister,1
2852,menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights,1
2853,a rattling noise,1
2854,and a bump on the head .,1
2855,another big,1
2856,dumb action movie in the vein of xxx,1
2857,the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .,1
2858,contrived,1
2859,maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received,1
2860,those rejected must have been astronomically bad .,1
2861,the film is almost eerily calm and refuses to take sides . but that lets its insights penetrate all the deeper .,1
2862,an endlessly fascinating,1
2863,landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years .,1
2864,this isn't a good movie ,1
2865,this isn't a bad movie . this is a movie that dispenses with the whole good/bad paradigm and exists on its own plane of reality .,1
2866,everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique,1
2867,which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .,1
2868,it's a smart,1
2869,funny look at an arcane area of popular culture,1
2870,and if it isn't entirely persuasive,1
2871,it does give exposure to some talented performers .,1
2872,an interesting,1
2873,if not entirely successful,1
2874,biography of two extraordinary personalities .,1
2875,`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying,1
2876,i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .,1
2877,trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then,1
2878,something terrible happens .,1
2879,the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers .,1
2880,almost everything about the film is unsettling,1
2881,from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences .,1
2882,vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .,1
2883,an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . .,1
2884,about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .,1
2885,saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles,1
2886,but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .,1
2887, . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie,1
2888,you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .,1
2889,this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for,1
2890,though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary .,1
2891,it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies,1
2892,but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette .,1
2893,a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .,1
2894,shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist,1
2895,but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high .,1
2896,though it's become almost redundant to say so,1
2897,major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class .,1
2898,this thing works on no level whatsoever for me .,1
2899,"a working class "" us vs . them "" opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .",1

2901,i have just one word for you -Â– decasia,1
2902,pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely,1
2903,the pace is serene,1
2904,the humor wry and sprightly .,1
2905,a photographic marvel of sorts,1
2906,and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community .,1
2907,after an uncertain start,1
2908,murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock's memorable first interrogation of gosling .,1
2909,the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics,1
2910,savor the pleasure of his sounds and images,1
2911,and ponder the historical,1
2912,philosophical,1
2913,and ethical issues that intersect with them .,1

2922,has this franchise ever run out of gas .,1
2923,[reno] may have a few grating gaps in logic and feels as if a good chunk of its story ended up on the cutting room floor,1
2924,but there is just enough charm and humor peppered throughout to make it feel as if it wasn't a complete waste of time to sit through .,1
2925,elegantly produced and expressively performed,1
2926,the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy .,1
2927,little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .,1
2928,soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted,1
2929,earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .,1
2930,this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology,1
2931,either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated .,1
2932,absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .,1
2933,sunshine state is sayles at his most robert altman-ish,1
2934,purposefully juggling about a dozen narrative balls in the air,1
2935,and letting the mundanity and smallish drama of everyday life tell a larger story .,1
2936,this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows .,1
2937,a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place,1
2938,but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .,1
2939,mostly honest,1
2940,this somber picture reveals itself slowly,1
2941,intelligently,1
2942,artfully .,1
2943,a generation x artifact,1
2944,capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last .,1
2945,the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more .,1

2948,unspools like a highbrow,1
2949,low-key,1
2950,102-minute infomercial,1
2951,blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .,1
2952,it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie,1
2953,but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter .,1
2954,a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end .,1
2955, . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .,1
2956,the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .,1
2957,the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message,1
2958,if indeed there is one .,1
2959,a recent favourite at sundance,1
2960,this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania .,1
2961,both stars manage to be funny,1
2962,but,1
2963,like the recent i spy,1
2964,the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .,1
2965,you have to pay attention to follow all the stories,1
2966,but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic,1
2967,and one to ponder after the credits roll .,1
2968,ultimately,1
2969,the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis .,1
2970,the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand .,1
2971,pretension,1
2972,in its own way,1
2973,is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast,1
2974,hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal .,1

2987,colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you,1
2988,burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .,1
2989,nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it,1
2990,from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute,1
2991,haphazard theatrical release .,1
2992,just isn't as weird as it ought to be .,1
2993,by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music,1
2994,[jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity .,1
2995,this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous .,1
2996,it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .,1
2997,moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and,1
2998,as it turns out,1
2999,more fragile -- than happiness .,1
3000,this is snappy,1
3001,frothy screwball comedy awash in french understatement .,1
3002,seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable,1
3003,the director's experiment is a successful one .,1
3004,i'm sure if you're a hartley fan,1
3005,you might enjoy yourself . . . me,1
3006,i didn't care for it .,1
3007,beautifully written and directed and packed with excellent performances .,1
3008,whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex,1
3009,the edge-of-your-seat,1
3010,educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment .,1
3011,this may not be great moviemaking . . . but it's vastly enjoyable in a low-down,1
3012,scandal-mongering way .,1
3013,this is almodovar's stab at serious drama,1
3014,and the result is bizarre and affecting but also unsettling in ways that the filmmaker may not have intended .,1
3015,thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big,1
3016,colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .,1
3017,the storylines are woven together skilfully,1
3018,the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking,1
3019,and the overall experience is awesome .,1
3020,a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick .,1
3021,director robert rodriguez has once again caught lightning in a bottle .,1
3022,try as you might to resist,1
3023,if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson,1
3024,this movie will worm its way there .,1
3025,there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .,1
3026,some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) served jews who escaped the holocaust .,1
3027,an entertaining but unspectacular film . pretty goofy at times - but the slick and gleefully self-indulgent violence will not disappoint the action fan .,1
3028,the film,1
3029,while not exactly assured in its execution,1
3030,is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .,1
3031, . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 .,1
3032,while the finished product is still fun,1
3033,never dull and the athletes themselves remarkable,1
3034,inspired and apt,1
3035,the production could have been improved .,1
3036,there are a few chuckles,1
3037,but not a single gag sequence that really scores,1
3038,and the stars seem to be in two different movies .,1
3039,there's no real reason to see it,1
3040,and no real reason not to .,1
3041,the film's final hour,1
3042,where nearly all the previous unseen material resides,1
3043,is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut .,1
3044,at once subtle and visceral,1
3045,the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful,1
3046,offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .,1
3047,a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat,1
3048,and if you're going to alter the bard's ending,1
3049,you'd better have a good alternative .,1
3050,broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force .,1
3051,on balance,1
3052,i recommend the movie both for nicholson's performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life,1
3053,but rarely see on screen .,1
3054,if you keep a list of films you want to see one way or another,1
3055,you would be doing yourself a service by keeping this film high up on that list .,1
3056,it doesn't do a lot of deep thinking,1
3057,but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x,1
3058,it does make a statement : freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems .,1
3059,like edward norton in american history x,1
3060,ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance .,1
3061,nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place,1
3062,while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances .,1
3063,the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .,1
3064,pc stability notwithstanding,1
3065,the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat,1
3066,fairy-tale conclusion .,1
3067,the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second .,1
3068,tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm,1
3069,but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .,1
3070,the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks,1
3071,plus moments of breathtaking mystery .,1
3072,you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report .,1
3073,interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .,1
3074,its salient points are simultaneously buried,1
3075,drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary .,1
3076,the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .,1
3077,a lot rides on coincidence . or fate . or the magic pull of the moon . it all makes sense in the end .,1
3078,i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .,1
3079,it challenges,1
3080,this nervy oddity,1
3081,like modern art should .,1
3082,an amusing,1
3083,breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail .,1
3084,there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .,1
3085,reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .,1
3086,lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks,1
3087,but not anyone else .,1
3088,an inept,1
3089,tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures,1
3090,it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch,1
3091,and no more .,1
3092,you know you're in for a good ol' popcorn-munching time when the movie's tagline is a bad pun on the title of a piece of fine literature .,1
3093,an engaging and specific portrait of a culture in transition,1
3094,even as it evokes humanity's most universal and timeless values .,1
3095,if this is the danish idea of a good time,1
3096,prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war,1
3097,perhaps .,1
3098,i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend !,1
3099,the woods haven't been this creepy since the blair witch project .,1
3100,accuracy and realism are terrific,1
3101,but if your film becomes boring,1
3102,and your dialogue isn't smart,1
3103,then you need to use more poetic license .,1
3104,the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny,1
3105,and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .,1
3106,film can't quite maintain its initial momentum,1
3107,but remains sporadically funny throughout .,1
3108,the soundtrack alone -- the literal pulse of the thing -- will rock you in your seat .,1
3109,the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem,1
3110,it is with most of these things,1
3111,is the script .,1
3112,while the film really doesn't have anything new to say,1
3113,it's still thoughtful and well-crafted .,1
3114,moore's complex and important film is also,1
3115,believe it or not,1
3116,immensely entertaining,1
3117,a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .,1
3118,it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .,1
3119,one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece .,1
3120,sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .,1
3121,as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids,1
3122,spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner .,1
3123,both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed,1
3124,assured of the wrong things,1
3125,and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .,1
3126,less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .,1
3127,the problem,1
3128,amazingly enough,1
3129,is the screenplay .,1
3130,although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale .,1
3131," "" the quiet american "" begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble .",1
3132,it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film,1
3133,but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .,1
3134,this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay,1
3135,in pops nathan lane .,1
3136,surprisingly,1
3137,considering that baird is a former film editor,1
3138,the movie is rather choppy .,1
3139,fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics,1
3140,genre thrills or inherent humor .,1
3141,for the first time in years,1
3142,de niro digs deep emotionally,1
3143,perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars .,1
3144,the touch is generally light enough and the performances,1
3145,for the most part,1
3146,credible .,1
3147,the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating,1
3148,but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .,1
3149,all ends well,1
3150,sort of,1
3151,but the frenzied comic moments never click .,1
3152,an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence .,1
3153,rife with the rueful,1
3154,wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language .,1
3155,worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .,1
3156,some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .,1
3157,it tries too hard,1
3158,and overreaches the logic of its own world .,1
3159,a little objectivity could have gone a long way .,1
3160,we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together,1
3161,and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .,1
3162,the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting .,1
3163,speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life .,1
3164,the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .,1
3165,the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .,1
3166,gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess,1
3167,whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .,1
3168,good,1

3174,often self-consciously surreal,1
3175,this award-winner scores high for originality .,1

3179,harmless entertainment for kids and just smart enough to appeal to parents .,1
3180, . . . too sappy for its own good .,1
3181,no,1
3182,the dangerous lives of altar boys does not exist in a state of perfect grace . however,1
3183,its sins are forgivably venial,1
3184,because its virtues are palpably human .,1
3185,the special effects and cgi,1
3186,uneven in sorcerer's stone,1
3187,are all spit-shine and shoe-polish in chamber of secrets . there isn't one hair out of place .,1
3188,my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake .,1
3189,chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .,1
3190,the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy,1
3191,life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .,1
3192,all in all,1
3193,it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .,1
3194,consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .,1
3195,it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times,1
3196,but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .,1
3197,the two leads,1
3198,nearly perfect in their roles,1
3199,bring a heart and reality that buoy the film,1
3200,and at times,1
3201,elevate it to a superior crime movie .,1
3202,this is a labor of love,1
3203,and while it may not be slick,1
3204,it is an endearing look at one man's selflessness and one team's determination .,1
3205,she may not be real,1
3206,but the laughs are .,1
3207,even if the ring has a familiar ring,1
3208,it's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror .,1
3209,like being trapped inside a huge video game,1
3210,where exciting,1
3211,inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .,1
3212,i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario,1
3213,and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .,1
3214,cinematic pyrotechnics aside,1
3215,the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time .,1
3216,it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything .,1
3217,too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .,1
3218,the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) .,1

3227,reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .,1
3228, . . . works within its own pensive and penetrating element . caustic and jaunty,1
3229,gangster no . 1 is a cynical sideshow that dismisses the notion that crime does not always pay .,1
3230,quite funny for the type of movie it is . . .,1
3231,painted with broad strokes but with a palette of rich,1
3232,colorful details .,1

3234,funny,1

3236,transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy .,1
3237,a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given .,1
3238,with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative .,1
3239,viewed as a travelogue of the little-known indian community that prospers on a little-known island,1

3241,the mystic masseur is successful .,1
3242,it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi .,1
3243,that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications .,1
3244,highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply,1
3245,but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up .,1
3246, . . . familiar and predictable,1
3247,and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .,1
3248,like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .,1

3252,this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments .,1
3253,a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere,1
3254,and just seems worse for the effort .,1
3255,on the whole,1
3256,the movie lacks wit,1
3257,feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .,1
3258, . . . sheds light on the darkest corner of america's soul Â– and the man with the torch is the unlikely figure of a shuffling,1

3306,done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment .,1
3307,this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese,1
3308,one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .,1
3309,far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat,1
3310,but more than that,1
3311,it's a work of enthralling drama .,1
3312,not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days,1
3313,but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .,1
3314,less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving,1
3315,which is powerful in itself .,1
3316,the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .,1
3317,even if it ultimately disappoints,1
3318,the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .,1
3319,the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time,1
3320,and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix .,1
3321,one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years .,1
3322,serry perfectly captures the peculiar climate,1
3323,creating uncanny echoes with today's situation .,1
3324,unfortunately,1
3325,the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .,1
3326, . . . unspeakably,1
3327,unbearably dull,1
3328,featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .,1

3330,at least it looks pretty .,1
3331,the acting alone is worth the price of admission .,1
3332,none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .,1

3341,like all abstract art,1

3738,flawed but riveting,1
3739,it won't be everyone's cocktail of choice,1
3740,but if you can suspend disbelief long enough,1
3741,you'll get a whopping good wallop without the hangover .,1
3742,bÃ©art and berling are both superb,1
3743,while huppert . . . is magnificent .,1
3744,starts out with tremendous promise,1
3745,introducing an intriguing and alluring premise,1
3746,only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .,1
3747,ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children,1
3748,and too preachy for adults .,1
3749,yes,1
3750,i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care,1
3751,so i didn't .,1
3752,though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way,1
3753,there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .,1
3754,this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people .,1
3755,presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .,1
3756,when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack,1
3757,the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean .,1
3758,there's a neat twist,1
3759,subtly rendered,1
3760,that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes,1
3761,but kang tacks on three or four more endings .,1
3762,not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .,1
3763,a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .,1
3764,"borrows a bit from the classics "" wait until dark "" and "" extremities "" . . . but in terms of its style",1
3765,the movie is in a class by itself .,1
3766,the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress,1
3767,even though her talent is supposed to be growing .,1
3768,should be seen and absorbed,1
3769,if only to recall that hollywood horror does,1
3770,occasionally,1
3771,get it more or less right .,1
3772,for a film about two mismatched buddies,1
3773,crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .,1
3774,the whole thing feels like a ruse,1
3775,a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or,1
3776,worse yet,1
3777,nonexistent -- ideas .,1
3778,like the best 60 minutes exposÃ©,1
3779,the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining .,1
3780,as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game,1
3781,juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre,1
3782,and a personal low for everyone involved .,1
3783,aimed at a new age audience,1
3784,but its subject's sincerity and gentle,1
3785,self-deprecating nature translate well to a general audience .,1
3786,the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments .,1
3787,astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent,1
3788,incoherent or just plain crap . indeed,1
3789,none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild .,1
3790,with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity,1
3791,everett remains a perfect wildean actor,1
3792,and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill .,1
3793,its story may be a thousand years old,1
3794,but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?,1
3795,"but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps "" being earnest "" overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . .",1
3796,deep intelligence and a warm,1
3797,enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .,1
3798,shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story .,1
3799,unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling .,1
3800,there's something with potential here,1
3801,but the movie decides,1
3802,like lavinia,1
3803,to go the conservative route .,1
3804,it will take a strong stomach for the ordinary viewer to maintain an appetite for pinochet apologetics after this litany of suffering .,1
3805,well-written,1
3806,nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored,1
3807,the film works on several levels,1
3808,openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull .,1
3809,scherfig,1
3810,who has had a successful career in tv,1
3811,tackles more than she can handle .,1
3812,a profoundly stupid affair,1
3813,populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .,1
3814,an intriguing,1
3815,richly detailed look at the early days of hollywood power and glamour .,1
3816,a warm but realistic meditation on friendship,1
3817,family and affection .,1
3818,the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .,1
3819,ozpetek succeeds in portraying small nuances that demonstrate the stages of love -- unrequited or blossoming -- and in showcasing the family structure created by a group of people who have been rejected for one reason or another .,1
3820,the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .,1
3821,mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .,1
3822," "" lovely and amazing is a story about real people . these people are insecure about their lives . they aren't convinced that there's some inner beauty about them . they see themselves as i suspect most people do",1
3823,mostly for the flaws . however,1
3824,these are still,1
3825,armed with a rad '80s soundtrack and a winning cast ( including indie rocker liz phair ),1
3826,cherish is an ingenious low-budget thriller .,1
3827,just like every other seagal movie,1
3828,only louder and without that silly ponytail .,1
3829,like life on the island,1
3830,the movie grows boring despite the scenery .,1
3831,a film worthy of comparison to truffaut's best cinematic poems .,1
3832,missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating,1
3833,riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane .,1
3834,a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . .,1
3835,if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright,1
3836,then blood work is for you .,1
3837,what makes this latest version of the four feathers the best so far are the beautiful desert locations ( in morocco ),1
3838,and the superb action sequences .,1
3839,takes us on a journey toward self-awareness that is both deadpan hilarious and profoundly moving .,1
3840,this is darkest drama reminiscent of antonin artaud's literary experiments in psychoanalysis .,1
3841,a markedly inactive film,1
3842,city is conversational bordering on confessional .,1
3843, coarse,1
3844,cliched and clunky,1
3845,this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .,1
3846,ki-duk kim has created a provocatively violent and sexual film with an oddly idyllic sensibility . it's a mysterious but ultimately rewarding experience .,1
3847,it's easy for a filmmaker to blow up the world -- but what shyamalan does is much riskier . he tries to blow our minds .,1
3848,one of the best examples of how to treat a subject,1
3849,you're not fully aware is being examined,1
3850,much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken .,1
3851,there's a sweetness to it that's disarming and diverting -- mostly thanks to performances of slater,1
3852,richard dreyfuss as his partner in crime,1
3853,and portia di rossi as dreyfuss' daughter .,1
3854,guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook,1
3855,rattled,1
3856,or rolled .,1
3857,a beautiful meditation on the life force and redemptive power of literature -- for writers and readers alike -- and on what it means to be fully alive,1
3858,navigating the rocky terrain between vision and execution .,1
3859,it is bad,1
3860,but certainly not without merit as entertainment .,1
3861,nothing's at stake,1
3862,just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still,1
3863,the derivative nine queens is lots of fun .,1
3864,it almost plays like solaris,1
3865,but with guns and jokes .,1
3866,the delicious trimmingsÂ…arrive early and stay late,1
3867,filling nearly every minuteÂ…with a lighthearted glow,1
3868,some impudent snickers,1
3869,and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two .,1
3870,a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .,1
3871,it could change america,1
3872,not only because it is full of necessary discussion points,1
3873,but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .,1
3874,the exploitative,1
3875,clumsily staged violence overshadows everything,1
3876,including most of the actors .,1
3877,the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption .,1
3878,it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .,1
3879,[diaz] can blunder into the crudest situations with such sweet innocence as to inspire giggles rather than groans .,1
3880,the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits,1
3881,headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .,1
3882,does a good job of establishing a time and place,1
3883,and of telling a fascinating character's story .,1
3884,the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ,1
3885,it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie .,1
3886,the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .,1
3887,one of the best films that showcase a romance within the context of an artistic movement,1
3888,stupid,1
3889,infantile,1
3890,redundant,1
3891,sloppy,1
3892,over-the-top,1
3893,and amateurish . yep,1
3894,"it's "" waking up in reno . "" go back to sleep .",1
3895,the story may not be new,1
3896,but australian director john polson,1
3897,making his american feature debut,1
3898,jazzes it up adroitly .,1
3899,anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed,1
3900,joyous romp of a film .,1
3901,perhaps no greater example yet exists of the beauty achievable when one is a master of the digital aesthetic .,1
3902,a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption .,1
3903,the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships,1
3904,including that between the son and his wife,1
3905,and the wife and the father,1
3906,and between the two brothers,1
3907,with incredible subtlety and acumen .,1
3908,the lightest,1
3909,most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him .,1
3910,a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others .,1
3911,to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers,1
3912,a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed .,1
3913,jonah is sunday school lite . but it's told with a comic edge usually associated with the devilish act of laughter .,1
3914,an entertaining,1
3915,surprisingly well-written and often rowdily amusing picture .,1
3916,it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .,1
3917,herzog,1
3918,a man of detail became enraptured with his subject and was unable to use his editing shears .,1
3919,the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried,1
3920,low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance .,1
3921,this is a stunning film,1
3922,a one-of-a-kind tour de force .,1
3923,this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences,1
3924,though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times .,1
3925,the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty,1
3926,while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts,1
3927,preciously exposed as history corners them .,1
3928,this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .,1
3929,two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .,1
3930,well-acted,1
3931,well-directed and,1
3932,for all its moodiness,1
3933,not too pretentious .,1
3934,rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight .,1
3935,it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ,1
3936,diesel,1
3937,with his brawny frame and cool,1
3938,composed delivery,1
3939,fits the bill perfectly .,1
3940, . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad .,1
3941,[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction,1
3942,nor are the uneven performances by the cast members,1
3943,who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent .,1
3944, . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers .,1
3945,feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens .,1
3946,contains the humor,1
3947,characterization,1
3948,poignancy,1
3949,and intelligence of a bad sitcom .,1
3950,fragmented,1
3951,elliptical and overplotted to the point of being hard to track . still,1
3952,it's worth hanging in for the finish . . . [when] soderbergh pulls off a delicious trick,1
3953,a gesture of pure,1
3954,tender,1
3955,unabashed movie love that makes up for everything .,1
3956,there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .,1
3957,this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short .,1
3958,this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly,1
3959,very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !,1
3960,mcconaughey's fun to watch,1
3961,the dragons are okay,1
3962,not much fire in the script .,1
3963,wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically,1
3964,and borrows heavily from lynch,1
3965,jeunet,1
3966,and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own .,1
3967,a committed,1
3968,intelligent and fascinating piece of work with no irony about it .,1
3969,the obnoxious special effects,1
3970,the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant,1
3971,so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy,1
3972,dopey old hanna-barbera charm .,1
3973,like the original,1
3974,this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit .,1
3975,raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen .,1
3976,rumor,1
3977,a muddled drama about coming to terms with death,1
3978,feels impersonal,1
3979,almost generic .,1
3980,solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining .,1
3981,captures all the longing,1
3982,anguish and ache,1
3983,the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world .,1
3984,[villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death .,1
3985,fun,1
3986,flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment .,1
3987,a sharp,1
3988,amusing study of the cult of celebrity .,1
3989,schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past .,1
3990, . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .,1
3991,an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief .,1
3992,it's incredibly enjoyable to watch derrida pick apart,1
3993,and fight against,1
3994,the very process and premise of making a film about someone,1
3995,particularly him .,1
3996,the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .,1
3997,thank goodness writer-director michael kalesniko found someone as verbally nimble as kenneth branagh to keep the whole enterprise afloat . he manages,1
3998,but just barely .,1
3999,schnieder bounces around with limp wrists,1
4000,wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers,1
4001,twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . .,1
4002,this lively klasky csupo production is a convincing amplification of the popular nickelodeon series .,1
4003,a compelling and thought-provoking drama on the armenian genocide after world war i and its toxic impact on the spirits and lives of some contemporary canadians .,1
4004,a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone .,1
4005,ramsay and morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling .,1
4006,just one more collection of penis,1
4007,breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .,1
4008,in trying to be daring and original,1
4009,it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .,1
4010,as a kind of colorful,1
4011,dramatized pbs program,1
4012,frida gets the job done . but,1
4013,for that,1
4014,why not watch a documentary ?,1
4015,claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications .,1
4016,nearly 75 years after the fact,1
4017,the matter still hasn't given up all its secrets,1
4018,but denis' film comes close to a definitive,1
4019,deeply disturbing account .,1
4020,it's supposed to be a humorous,1
4021,all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .,1
4022,its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) .,1
4023,this is a beautifully sensitive portrait of a unique school and,1
4024,a very special teacher .,1
4025,as david letterman and the onion have proven,1
4026,the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor,1
4027,but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .,1
4028,it's dumb fun slapped silly,1
4029,a new franchise inspired by the bond films that's not far from the porn its title promises ,1
4030,the film is a veritable orgy of outrageous stunts .,1
4031,a model of what films like this should be like .,1
4032,the movie is amateurish,1
4033,but it's a minor treat .,1
4034,directing with a sure and measured hand,1
4035,[haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .,1
4036,as a revenge thriller,1
4037,the movie is serviceable,1
4038,but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions .,1
4039,skins has a desolate air,1
4040,but eyre,1
4041,a native american raised by white parents,1
4042,manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor .,1
4043,vera has created a provocative,1
4044,absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores .,1
4045,the acting by the over-25s lacks spark,1
4046,with csokas particularly unconnected .,1
4047,carion relies on a gesture or passages of silence to get his point across ,1
4048,it's a technique that packs a greater emotional punch than a tidy,1
4049,hollywood-style monologue ever would .,1
4050,a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters .,1
4051,an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick .,1
4052,it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow .,1
4053,a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .,1
4054,should appeal to more than just hardcore hip-hop fans .,1
4055,me no lika da accents so good,1
4056,but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects .,1
4057,a powerful,1
4058,compelling and intelligent if imperfect work . . . a film of enormous ambition which realizes its aims more often than not .,1
4059,this is mostly well-constructed fluff,1
4060,which is all it seems intended to be .,1
4061,extreme oops - oops,1
4062,ops,1
4063,no matter how you spell it,1
4064,it's still a mistake to go see it .,1
4065,aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea,1
4066,the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .,1
4067,this spawn of william shakespeare and ray kroc has more fun with [the] thin premise than you might expect,1
4068,mostly because of maura tierney .,1
4069,human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy,1
4070,but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .,1
4071,i've had more interesting -- and,1
4072,dare i say,1
4073,thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf,1
4074,point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .,1
4075,what we have here is an examination of fathers,1
4076,sons and sibling rivalry - squared and sideways,1
4077,this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england,1
4078,and ably captures the speech patterns,1
4079,moral codes and ideals of the 1940s .,1
4080,if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ),1
4081,or see some interesting storytelling devices,1
4082,you might want to check it out,1
4083,but there's nothing very attractive about this movie .,1
4084,the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .,1
4085,interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe,1
4086,hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses .,1
4087,this is surely one of the most frantic,1
4088,virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio .,1
4089,it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up,1
4090,a terrific climax,1
4091,and some nice chills along the way .,1
4092,an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .,1
4093,smith examines the intimate,1
4094,unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country .,1
4095,no one,1
4096,including the viewers,1
4097,seems to know who can be trusted,1
4098,and that's what makes this movie fun to watch .,1
4099,reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset,1
4100,and its capacity to heal using creative,1
4101,natural and ancient antidotes .,1
4102,equilibrium the movie,1
4103,as opposed to the manifesto,1
4104,is really,1
4105,really stupid .,1
4106,though it is by no means his best work,1
4107,laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master,1
4108,a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .,1
4109,brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .,1
4110,when you resurrect a dead man,1
4111,hard copy should come a-knocking,1
4112,no ?,1
4113,while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock,1

4119,though,1
4120,and if they're old enough to have developed some taste,1
4121,so will your kids .,1
4122,there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ?,1
4123,just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .,1
4124, . . . the best movie featuring the next generation cast,1
4125,and a movie that's ( almost ) every bit as great as [treks] ii and vi .,1
4126,the real draw,1
4127,though,1
4128,is the performance by dunst that is,1
4129,alone,1
4130,worth the price of admission .,1
4131,beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .,1

4153,the essential problem in orange county is that,1
4154,having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast,1
4155,the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .,1
4156,too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence,1
4157,despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors,1
4158,and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .,1
4159,two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .,1
4160,parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material,1
4161,but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core .,1
4162,a must see for all sides of the political spectrum,1

4166,this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt,1
4167,or will feel someday .,1

4217,a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it,1
4218,offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much .,1
4219,even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many,1

4284,we've been here,1
4285,done that .,1
4286,green dragon falls prey to some threadbare hollywood conventions,1
4287,but otherwise maintains a high level of maturity and emotion as it examines the lives of vietnamese refugees entering america in 1975 .,1
4288,[chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative,1
4289,accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively,1

4295,blood work is a strong,1
4296,character-oriented piece .,1
4297,seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool,1
4298,and it's a sad,1
4299,sick sight .,1
4300,the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .,1

4302,like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine .,1

4306,it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel .,1
4307,fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film,1
4308,but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .,1
4309,it's too self-important and plodding to be funny,1
4310,and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .,1
4311,fast-paced and wonderfully edited,1
4312,the film is extremely thorough .,1
4313,as a study of how the current corporate idiocy impacts one man's art,1

4316,a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies .,1

4318,it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .,1

4320,with wit and empathy to spare,1
4321,waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism .,1
4322,bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers .,1
4323,although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers,1

4325,headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude .,1
4326,it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .,1
4327,some may quibble that the 144-minute length accommodates at least one too many endings . but such quibbling will diminish in view of the film's overall impact .,1

4336,in imax in short,1

4340,the entire movie is in need of a scented bath .,1
4341, . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . .,1
4342,so infectious,1
4343,so colorful,1
4344,so exhilarating,1
4345,that you almost forget that at its core,1
4346,it's merely a curry-inflected remake of father of the bride,1
4347,with snippets of other films thrown in .,1
4348,perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing,1

4355,by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic .,1
4356,although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness,1
4357,those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime .,1
4358,an incredibly thoughtful,1
4359,deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks .,1
4360,the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature,1
4361,nor a hip,1
4362,contemporary,1
4363,in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between,1
4364,and it works .,1
4365,too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .,1
4366,the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long,1
4367,trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war,1
4368,revolution,1
4369,communism,1

4381,its story about a young chinese woman,1

4384,"remember the kind of movie we were hoping "" ecks vs . sever "" or "" xxx "" was going to be ? this is it .",1

4398,turns out to be much more complex than the originally released gem .,1
4399,in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating,1
4400,genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills,1
4401,the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .,1
4402,despite its shortcomings,1
4403,girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch,1
4404,and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre .,1
4405,bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense,1
4406,and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .,1

4417,pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness,1
4418,but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins .,1
4419,a collage of clichÃ©s and a dim echo of allusions to other films .,1
4420,somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever,1

4617,there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film .,1

4630,a muckraking job,1
4631,the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment,1
4632,and a fairly effective one at that .,1
4633, . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .,1
4634,kudos to this first-time feature director for braiding his insider experience into something quite singular .,1
4635,hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue .,1

4637,the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it,1
4638,and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it .,1

4654,overnight,1
4655,"is robbed and replaced with a persecuted "" other . """,1
4656,as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type,1
4657,more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script,1
4658,which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .,1
4659,the film just might turn on many people to opera,1
4660,in general,1
4661,an art form at once visceral and spiritual,1
4662,wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .,1
4663,a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure .,1
4664,wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award .,1
4665,so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt .,1
4666,although dampened by intermittent preachiness and an unconvincingly pat and uplifting resolution . . . changing lanes nevertheless taps into emotions so convincing it elevates the movie above its own shortcomings .,1

4669,everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing,1
4670,a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers,1

4674,but shamelessly manipulative movie making .,1
4675,a dark,1
4676,dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .,1
4677,the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .,1
4678,like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing,1
4679,penetrating,1
4680,impenetrable .,1
4681,lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life,1
4682,because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun .,1

4685,a story full of surprises,1
4686,defined by the use of interesting camera utilization and visual motifs .,1
4687,i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .,1
4688,throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all,1
4689,nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another .,1
4690,sandra bullock,1
4691,despite downplaying her good looks,1
4692,carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .,1
4693,the story . . . is inspiring,1
4694,ironic,1
4695,and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band .,1
4696,chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy,1
4697,but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws .,1
4698,heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart .,1
4699,a live-action cartoon,1
4700,a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .,1
4701,large budget notwithstanding,1
4702,the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time,1
4703,the old mib label stands for milder isn't better .,1
4704,it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making .,1
4705,go for la salle's performance,1
4706,and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .,1
4707,an exhaustive investigation into the roots and after-effects of the revolutions and counter-revolutions that rocked france,1

4709,china,1
4710,latin america and czechoslovakia in 1967 and 1968 .,1
4711,holland lets things peter out midway,1
4712,but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .,1
4713,thankfully,1
4714,the film,1
4715,which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda .,1
4716,the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally,1
4717,one so unconventional,1
4718,gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .,1
4719,the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .,1
4720,sheridan had a wonderful account to work from,1
4721,but,1
4722,curiously,1
4723,he waters it down,1

4725,the quality of schwentke's visuals . . . provides ample compensation .,1
4726,"but buying into sham truths and routine "" indie "" filmmaking",1
4727,freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible,1
4728,just horribly mediocre .,1

4730,new jersey,1
4731,this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins .,1

4734,how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .,1
4735,overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances .,1
4736,the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20,1

4747,the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america .,1
4748,it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun .,1
4749,labute's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .,1
4750,a full world has been presented onscreen,1
4751,not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .,1
4752,this is cool,1
4753,slick stuff,1

4792,but it is as good as we've seen him be in much too long a time .,1
4793,it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins .,1
4794,though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus,1
4795,the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .,1

4849,this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .,1
4850,it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film,1
4851,with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing,1
4852,a gracefully acted,1
4853,unsentimental,1
4854,quite likable little coming-of-age movie .,1
4855,if you love reading and/or poetry,1
4856,then by all means check it out . you'll probably love it .,1
4857,impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances,1
4858,but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters,1
4859,the story is just too slim .,1
4860,painful,1
4861,horrifying and oppressively tragic,1
4862,this film should not be missed .,1
4863,[o]ften a capable documentary on an interesting subject,1
4864,even if it doesn't probe as deeply as it could .,1
4865,[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism,1
4866,jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .,1
4867,a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .,1
4868,there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie,1
4869,but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .,1
4870,a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously,1
4871,folks,1
4872,it doesn't work .,1
4873,it's unnerving,1
4874,stimulating,1
4875,likely to provoke anger and sorrow on both political sides -- and,1
4876,above all,1
4877,it's extremely funny .,1
4878,the project honors [dickens'] passionate voice,1
4879,and the strong ensemble cast sees us through a few tonal shifts .,1
4880,fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative,1
4881,but he does display an original talent .,1
4882,it's still a comic book,1
4883,but maguire makes it a comic book with soul .,1
4884,an inventive,1
4885,absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist .,1
4886, . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating,1
4887,that is,1
4888,for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .,1
4889,every moment crackles with tension,1
4890,and by the end of the flick,1
4891,you're on the edge of your seat .,1
4892,the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre,1
4893,funny,1
4894,tragic - like love in new york ) .,1
4895,by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world,1
4896,pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so .,1
4897,even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen,1
4898,he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch .,1
4899, . . . has a bit more going for it than just bikini babes and bitchin' waves . but the plot is ankle deep at best .,1
4900,unfortunately,1
4901,it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .,1
4902,buy is an accomplished actress,1
4903,and this is a big,1
4904,juicy role .,1
4905,it's sweet,1
4906,funny,1
4907,charming,1
4908,and completely delightful .,1
4909,the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent,1
4910,meandering,1
4911,and sometimes dry plot .,1
4912,medem packs it with so much stunning,1
4913,wildly colorful imagery -- and so much sex -- that it transfixes you even when you're not quite sure what's going on .,1
4914,highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast,1
4915,it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role .,1
4916,despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot,1
4917,moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . .,1
4918,schefberg has the courage to make the story messily un-formulaic .,1
4919,the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .,1
4920,ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar .,1
4921,i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier,1
4922,by rohmer,1
4923,for example .,1
4924,even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene,1
4925,in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia,1
4926,it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .,1
4927,wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd,1
4928,but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .,1
4929,[nÃ¦s] directed the stage version of elling,1
4930,and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage .,1
4931,adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book .,1
4932,what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level .,1
4933,a subtle,1
4934,poignant picture of goodness that is flawed,1
4935,compromised and sad .,1
4936,no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story .,1
4937,maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages,1
4938,"but something aboul "" full frontal "" seems",1
4939,well,1
4940,contrived .,1
4941,a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man,1
4942,and more about that man lost in its midst .,1
4943,this is human comedy at its most amusing,1
4944,interesting and confirming .,1
4945,this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .,1
4946,if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park,1
4947,you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .,1
4948,a real step forward for the digital video revolution .,1
4949,more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang,1
4950,which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet,1
4951,melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films .,1
4952,an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best .,1
4953,just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .,1
4954,kissing jessica stein is your standard romantic comedy,1
4955,only better : twice the chicks and half the guys .,1
4956,the film is reasonably entertaining,1
4957,though it begins to drag two-thirds through,1
4958,when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .,1
4959,the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula,1
4960,though,1
4961,and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .,1
4962,hard as this may be to believe,1
4963,here on earth,1
4964,a surprisingly similar teen drama,1
4965,was a better film .,1
4966,this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while,1
4967,a meander through worn-out material .,1
4968,has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .,1
4969,it's a subtle mood piece in which a man's collapse is examined so rigorously that one almost hopes for a murder to come along and break the tension .,1
4970,first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving,1
4971,effective little film .,1
4972,the acting is just fine,1
4973,but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes,1
4974,especially with the weak payoff .,1
4975,cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause,1
4976,but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill,1
4977,didactic cartoon .,1
4978,after all the big build-up,1
4979,the payoff for the audience,1
4980,as well as the characters,1
4981,is messy,1
4982,murky,1
4983,unsatisfying .,1
4984,the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .,1
4985,the funny thing is,1
4986,i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit .,1
4987,[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein,1
4988,and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike .,1
4989,it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity,1
4990,[yet] are worthwhile .,1
4991,despite cramming in numerous clichÃ©s,1
4992,mehta still manages to put a fresh and funny spin on the proceedings .,1
4993,it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch,1
4994,yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it .,1
4995,skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics,1
4996,but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults .,1
4997,although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds,1
4998,there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun .,1
4999,an ambitious,1
5000,serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ,1
5001,sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .,1
5002,this is an ungainly movie,1
5003,ill-fitting,1
5004,with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .,1
5005,borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .,1
5006,when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra,1
5007,it finds a nice rhythm .,1
5008,if you love the music,1
5009,and i do,1
5010,its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . .,1
5011,hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious,1
5012,but scathingly witty nonetheless .,1
5013,no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it .,1
5014,none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life,1
5015,unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .,1
5016,by turns whimsical and absurdist,1
5017,babek payami's secret ballot is a slight but likable iranian film with the flavor of a shaggy-dog story conceived by samuel beckett and directed by jim jarmusch .,1
5018,if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog .,1
5019,vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women .,1
5020,would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character,1
5021,melanie carmichael,1
5022,with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic .,1
5023,although sensitive to a fault,1
5024,it's often overwritten,1
5025,with a surfeit of weighty revelations,1
5026,flowery dialogue,1
5027,and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .,1
5028,a fascinating,1
5029,unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .,1
5030,it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,1
5031,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .,1
5032, . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance,1
5033, . . . best seen as speculative history,1
5034,as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report .,1
5035,what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed,1
5036,natural-seeming actors .,1
5037,francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them .,1
5038,tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before,1
5039,but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably .,1
5040,sandler,1
5041,in trusting his director,1
5042,gives a performance that declares the star a genuinely fine actor .,1
5043,they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .,1
5044,they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .,1
5045,kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope .,1
5046,as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh,1
5047,the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story,1
5048,the more details slip out between his fingers .,1
5049,having had the good sense to cast actors who are,1
5050,generally speaking,1
5051,adored by the movie-going public,1
5052,khouri then gets terrific performances from them all .,1
5053,my oh my,1
5054,is this an invigorating,1
5055,electric movie .,1
5056, . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .,1
5057,fontaine indulges her signature style,1
5058,creating a carefully measured film -- the kind whose impact slowly sneaks up on its audience and haunts them long after leaving the theatre .,1
5059,from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat,1
5060,vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way,1
5061,comparable to the classic films of jean renoir .,1
5062,it's a terrible movie in every regard,1
5063,and utterly painful to watch .,1
5064,despite its dry wit and compassion,1
5065,the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .,1
5066,there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but,1
5067,in the end,1
5068,the disparate elements don't gel .,1
5069, . . . a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture .,1
5070,one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album .,1
5071,it's not particularly subtle . . . however,1
5072,it still manages to build to a terrifying,1
5073,if obvious,1
5074,conclusion .,1
5075,photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic .,1
5076,does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?,1
5077,here's my advice,1
5078,kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .,1
5079,schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies,1
5080,and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .,1
5081,the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .,1
5082,watching e . t now,1
5083,in an era dominated by cold,1
5084,loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas,1
5085,one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .,1
5086,borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking,1
5087,the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .,1
5088,lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete,1
5089,a movie star,1
5090,and an image of black indomitability .,1
5091,[aniston is] so good,1
5092,she manages to overcome the occasional nuggets of preciousness and self-consciousness in the story .,1
5093,attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both,1
5094,but succeeds in making neither .,1
5095,this is a rare twisted crowd-pleaser for longtime fans as well as novices -- or for those that don't know an arachnid from an insect .,1
5096, in its own remarkable and unshowy way,1
5097,this movie is truly about how sept . 11 seemed to equalize and unite new yorkers across imaginary barriers of class and lifestyle .,1
5098,a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .,1
5099,the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .,1
5100,the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles .,1
5101,an excellent date movie,1
5102,because you and your date will likely be clinging on to each other within 10 minutes .,1
5103,a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail .,1
5104,miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .,1
5105,not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .,1
5106,oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .,1
5107,a perfectly acceptable,1
5108,perfectly bland,1
5109,competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .,1
5110,ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . .,1
5111,there are cheesy backdrops,1
5112,ridiculous action sequences,1
5113,and many tired jokes about men in heels .,1
5114,watching living actors interact against the lush,1
5115,studied inertia of the backdrops gives us the impression of history come to life,1
5116,or statues magically transformed into living creatures .,1
5117,"it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : "" got aids yet ? """,1
5118,never rising above routine episodic storytelling,1
5119,white oleander nonetheless retains something of its source novel's ravaged emotional surface and cool,1
5120,observant manner .,1
5121,has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .,1
5122,although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure,1
5123,it feels more forced than usual .,1

5128,yet engrossing piece . lux,1

5135,interestingly told film .,1
5136,handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .,1
5137,<em>the crocodile hunter : collision course</em> is one of the most unusual movies i've ever seen,1
5138,but it remains faithful to irwin's appeal,1
5139,and therefore it works .,1
5140,for a movie about the power of poetry and passion,1
5141,there is precious little of either .,1
5142,the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .,1

5150,a shrewd and splendidly volatile b movie structured around a highly original gambit of suspense .,1
5151,the cynicism is colossal,1
5152,the casting superb : norton may be the only actor alive who could pull off a character like sherman,1
5153,without making him either an idiot or a parody .,1
5154,gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again .,1

5165,essentially,1
5166,the film is weak on detail and strong on personality,1
5167,if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy,1
5168,scary effectiveness .,1
5169,"the first half is a hilariously on-target send-up of "" barbarella "" -style flicks and the larger-than-life egos that propelled them",1
5170,the second half is a ponderously self-absorbed meditation on the angst of a budding artiste .,1
5171,the longer version may be truer to tornatore's tripartite vision--and less simply cloying and calculated--but ultimately it's also less coherent and emotionally satisfying .,1
5172,'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about,1
5173,the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .,1
5174,this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .,1
5175,as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends,1
5176,it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .,1
5177,this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating,1
5178,albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border .,1

5224,the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare .,1
5225,moody,1
5226,heartbreaking,1
5227,and filmed in a natural,1
5228,unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not .,1
5229,this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .,1
5230,windtalkers blows this way and that,1
5231,but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass,1
5232,true to himself .,1
5233,a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .,1
5234,the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams,1
5235,an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges .,1
5236,it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles,1
5237,but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress .,1
5238,will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them .,1
5239,the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies .,1
5240,less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .,1
5241,the splendid ensemble cast inhabits these unglamorous roles with quiet gusto .,1
5242,i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute .,1
5243,trivial where it should be profound,1
5244,and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .,1
5245,hawn lets it all hang out in this film and i have to admire her guts . sarandon is equally bold and daring in her portrayal of a woman who has lost her way in a closet full of beige suits .,1
5246,an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .,1
5247,parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion,1
5248,offers a pleasant,1
5249,challenging and quirky puzzle well worth working out .,1
5250,even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering,1
5251,miller's hand often feels unsure .,1
5252, . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen .,1
5253,in a big corner office in hell,1
5254,satan is throwing up his hands in surrender,1
5255,is firing his r&d people,1
5256,and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 .,1
5257,as the empire strikes back was to star wars,1
5258,so harry potter and the chamber of secrets is to last year's freshman introduction . in short,1
5259,it's bigger and better .,1
5260,not for the prurient or squeamish,1
5261,it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture,1
5262,self-loathing and sexual politics .,1
5263,a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope .,1
5264,it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic,1
5265,urgent,1
5266,and not sugarcoated in the least .,1
5267,[drumline] is entertaining for what it does,1
5268,and admirable for what it doesn't do .,1
5269,the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might,1
5270,thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead,1
5271,yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .,1
5272,despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .,1
5273,j-lo strikes back in a tense and thrilling revenge flick with the best fight scene so far this year . but i couldn't help feeling guilty over my delight at the brutal way 'enough' ended .,1
5274,an entertaining,1
5275,if somewhat standardized,1
5276,action movie .,1
5277,remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies .,1
5278,it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies,1
5279,and gibson,1
5280,stepping in for bruce willis,1
5281,is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .,1
5282,i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director,1
5283,but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie .,1
5284,adam sandler's heart may be in the right place,1
5285,but he needs to pull his head out of his butt,1
5286,if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter,1
5287,this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution,1
5288,this is it .,1
5289,it's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! . . . in this incarnation its fizz is infectious .,1
5290,in a movie full of surprises,1
5291,the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy,1
5292,both gentle and biting .,1
5293,only an epic documentary could get it all down,1
5294,and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .,1
5295,set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york .,1
5296,the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional .,1
5297,a well-done film of a self-reflexive,1
5298,philosophical nature .,1
5299,a composition of gestures stripped of romance and presented in their barest forms .,1
5300,best of all is garcia,1
5301,who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .,1
5302,his best film remains his shortest,1
5303,the hole,1
5304,which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .,1
5305,[the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward,1
5306,emotionally honest manner that by the end,1
5307,it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is,1
5308,at its core,1
5309,deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful .,1
5310,a thoroughly awful movie--dumb,1
5311,narratively chaotic,1
5312,visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . ',1
5313,harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again,1
5314,and while that is a cliche,1
5315,nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one .,1
5316,it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock,1
5317,garry shandling and colin quinn .,1
5318,how often do you see a movie about a subject that truly frightens you ?,1
5319,following ram dass down from his pedestal gives mr . lemle a way into his subject that will compel the viewer .,1
5320,what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video,1
5321,whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb .,1
5322,the sound of ma's cello alone is reason not to miss naqoyqatsi .,1
5323,handled correctly,1
5324,wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here,1
5325,alas,1
5326,it collapses like an overcooked soufflÃ© .,1
5327,too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique,1
5328,casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries .,1
5329,despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing,1
5330,the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .,1
5331,this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker,1
5332,but ayres makes the right choices at every turn .,1
5333,everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there,1
5334,for everybody who wants to be a kid again,1
5335,or show it to their own kids .,1
5336,a special kind of movie,1
5337,this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . .,1
5338,this is a heartfelt mea culpa -- which gives paid in full much of its unexpected emotional power .,1
5339,a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system,1
5340, . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds,1
5341,the power of this movie is undeniable .,1
5342,the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming .,1
5343,although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor,1
5344,the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke .,1
5345,the chateau belongs to rudd,1
5346,whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot .,1
5347,a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless,1
5348,lifeless,1
5349,meandering,1
5350,loud,1
5351,painful,1
5352,obnoxious .,1
5353,being a sayles film,1
5354,this has a way of looking at things with more patience and maturity than a plot summary might lead us to expect .,1
5355,just entertaining enough not to hate,1
5356,too mediocre to love .,1
5357,an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else .,1
5358, . . . captures the pain and desperation of adolescent powerlessness and humiliation with powerful intimacy . . .,1
5359,this time,1
5360,the hype is quieter,1
5361,and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first,1
5362,it's still a rollicking good time for the most part .,1
5363,miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .,1
5364,watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it .,1
5365,a static and sugary little half-hour,1
5366,after-school special about interfaith understanding,1
5367,stretched out to 90 minutes .,1
5368,talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be,1
5369,but it's still quite worth seeing .,1
5370,this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .,1
5371,sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists,1
5372,idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it .,1
5373,though excessively tiresome,1
5374,the uncertainty principle,1
5375,as verbally pretentious as the title may be,1
5376,has its handful of redeeming features,1
5377,as long as you discount its ability to bore .,1
5378,read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love .,1
5379,wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating,1
5380,so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .,1
5381,it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears,1
5382,to be a girl in a world of boys,1
5383,to be a boy truly in love with a girl,1
5384,and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .,1
5385,the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .,1
5386,yes,1
5387,mibii is rote work and predictable,1
5388,but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it .,1
5389,there is a real subject here,1
5390,and it is handled with intelligence and care .,1
5391,the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series .,1
5392, . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully .,1
5393,viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .,1
5394,the kind of history lesson that you wouldn't mind seeing again and again,1
5395,no matter the format .,1
5396,to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .,1
5397,just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart,1
5398,time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain .,1
5399,the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .,1
5400,rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material .,1
5401,writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this,1
5402,this is who you are,1
5403,' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .,1
5404,it questions whether we really live in a world that can be divided neatly into black hats and white hats . and anyway,1
5405,it wonders,1
5406,is the guy in the black hat always wrong ?,1
5407,it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy .,1
5408,what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion,1
5409,as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action .,1
5410,the film is like sitting in a downtown cafÃ©,1
5411,overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing,1
5412,and desperately wishing you could change tables .,1
5413,this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned .,1
5414,this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen .,1
5415,feels like a cold old man going through the motions .,1
5416,there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .,1
5417,turns out to be a nifty swashbuckler whose plot easily could have been lifted from a number of douglas fairbanks silent pictures .,1
5418,manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it .,1
5419,you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ,1
5420,i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week .,1
5421,watching this film,1
5422,one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is,1
5423,at bottom,1
5424,a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power .,1
5425,the film presents a brief but intriguing biography of its subject .,1
5426,a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not,1
5427,and in the end,1
5428,it is almost a good movie .,1
5429,the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .,1
5430,despite the opulent lushness of every scene,1
5431,the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .,1
5432,a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido .,1
5433,payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process,1
5434,but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .,1
5435,as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer,1
5436,the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .,1
5437,the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure,1
5438,but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .,1
5439,bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake .,1
5440,it's plotless,1
5441,shapeless -- and yet,1
5442,it must be admitted,1
5443,not entirely humorless . indeed,1
5444,the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .,1
5445,the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average,1
5446,at best,1
5447,i'm afraid .,1
5448,long before it's over,1
5449,you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .,1
5450,culkin,1
5451,who's in virtually every scene,1
5452,shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield .,1
5453,crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls .,1
5454,bernal's transformation from naive priest to tortured adulterer to hard-nosed careerist is riveting .,1
5455,enigma looks great,1
5456,has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .,1
5457,though there are many tense scenes in trapped,1
5458,they prove more distressing than suspenseful .,1
5459,the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian .,1
5460,more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .,1
5461,it's burns' visuals,1
5462,characters and his punchy dialogue,1
5463,not his plot,1
5464,that carry waydowntown .,1
5465,see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned,1
5466,you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died .,1
5467,shows that jackie chan is getting older,1
5468,and that's something i would rather live in denial about,1
5469,guy gets girl,1
5470,guy loses girl,1
5471,audience falls asleep .,1
5472,craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters .,1
5473,stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity,1
5474,profanity and violence,1
5475,labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection .,1
5476, . . . very funny,1
5477,very enjoyable . . .,1
5478,a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose,1

5481,visually engrossing,1
5482,seldom hammy,1
5483,honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction .,1
5484,the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation .,1
5485,it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .,1
5486,red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal,1
5487,and less emotionally affecting than silence . but,1
5488,like silence,1
5489,it's a movie that gets under your skin .,1
5490,his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude,1
5491,calculated to provoke shocked laughter,1
5492,without following up on a deeper level .,1
5493,so unassuming and pure of heart,1
5494,you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'safe ! ',1
5495,shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . .,1
5496,'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa,1

5500,some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ,1
5501,others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .,1
5502,one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one,1
5503,but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen,1
5504,just for them .,1
5505,a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .,1
5506,if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling,1
5507,some of its repartee is still worth hearing .,1
5508,not only is it a charming,1
5509,funny and beautifully crafted import,1
5510,it uses very little dialogue,1
5511,making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .,1
5512,terminally bland,1
5513,painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie,1
5514,shot on digital videotape rather than film,1
5515,is frequently indecipherable .,1
5516,one of the pleasures in walter's documentary . . . is the parade of veteran painters,1
5517,confounded dealers,1
5518,and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject's mysterious personality without ever explaining him .,1
5519,if you're over 25,1
5520,have an iq over 90,1
5521,and have a driver's license,1
5522,you should be able to find better entertainment .,1
5523,a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale,1
5524,standard,1
5525,connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world .,1
5526,spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society,1
5527,but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .,1
5528,director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10,1
5529,000 times .,1
5530,a film that loses sight of its own story .,1
5531,astonishingly skillful and moving . . . it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one .,1
5532,leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him,1
5533,and it works superbly here .,1
5534,its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar,1
5535,but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and,1
5536,at the same time,1
5537,is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .,1
5538,"the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives "" mothman "" an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .",1
5539,the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based .,1
5540,a highly spirited,1
5541,imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he's afraid of his best-known creation ?,1
5542,it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .,1
5543,both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie,1
5544,and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver .,1
5545,the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .,1
5546,a playful iranian parable about openness,1
5547,particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences .,1
5548,muccino,1
5549,who directed from his own screenplay,1
5550,is a canny crowd pleaser,1
5551,and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .,1
5552, . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ),1

5765,although tender and touching,1
5766,the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing .,1
5767,the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .,1

5854,and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less .,1
5855,the film is probably worth seeing for the sheer spectacle of it all,1

5963,[moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface,1
5964,at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .,1

6041,robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows .,1
6042,there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going,1
6043,or how long it's going to take to get there .,1
6044,the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal .,1
6045,it's not life-affirming Â— its vulgar and mean,1
6046,but i liked it .,1
6047,a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity .,1
6048,this is a third-person story now,1
6049,told by hollywood,1
6050,and much more ordinary for it .,1
6051,one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically,1
6052,the movie is a disaster .,1
6053,an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and,1
6054,worse,1
6055,that you have to pay if you want to see it .,1
6056,at times funny and at other times candidly revealing,1

6061,taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .,1
6062,it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline,1
6063,and once the initial high wears off,1

6082,serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and,1
6083,perhaps unwittingly,1
6084,relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .,1

6107,you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness,1
6108,but the point is,1
6109,you'll laugh .,1
6110,though the characters are sometimes forced into madcap situations for the sake of adding yuks,1

6134,while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century,1
6135,and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets,1

6329,extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say,1
6330,entertaining !,1
6331,provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views .,1
6332,the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next .,1
6333,the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk,1
6334,amusing pace .,1
6335,in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes,1
6336,it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people,1
6337,a project in which the script and characters hold sway .,1
6338,evans is such a capable storyteller that you find yourself liking him even though he's not exactly likeable .,1
6339,for the most part,1
6340,the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together .,1
6341,fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors,1
6342,it is worth searching out .,1
6343,the acting,1
6344,costumes,1
6345,music,1
6346,cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales .,1
6347,undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof .,1
6348,i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes,1
6349,but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .,1
6350,disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesÂ…or any other john woo flick for that matter .,1
6351,ranks with such films as in the bedroom,1
6352,ordinary people,1
6353,and terms of endearment in the sensitivity with which it observes the effect a child's death on the remaining members of the family .,1
6354,time out plays out slowly,1
6355,but vincent's disconnectedness creates odd suspense and black humor .,1
6356,i'm not sure all about lily chou-chou made sense in my head,1
6357,but it made sense in my heart .,1
6358,needless to say,1
6359,the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .,1
6360,a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .,1
6361,in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance,1
6362,he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .,1
6363,it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling,1
6364,but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .,1
6365,stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end,1
6366,along with green's half-hearted movie career .,1
6367,it's got the brawn,1
6368,but not the brains .,1
6369,an entertaining and poignantly bittersweet take-down of a good man's midlife crisis .,1
6370,alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life,1
6371,big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl .,1
6372,hawke's film,1
6373,a boring,1
6374,pretentious waste of nearly two hours,1
6375,doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny,1
6376,pathetic,1
6377,starving and untalented artistes .,1
6378,there is a fine psychological thriller about divided loyalties and ambiguous identities buried with all the rubble and the maimed bodies,1
6379,and mr . han and ms . kim play their slightly absurd roles with brisk sincerity,1
6380,you really have to wonder how on earth anyone,1
6381,anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .,1
6382,this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers,1
6383,it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .,1
6384, . . . the movie just seemed to be trying too hard to be something different . .,1
6385,a kinetic drama that seems to wander aimlessly,1
6386,beautifully until it crashes in an odd anti-climax befitting reality itself .,1
6387,a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors,1
6388,even kingsley,1
6389,are made to look bad .,1
6390,this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood .,1
6391,is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ?,1
6392,seeing it as a westerner is an enlightening,1
6393,even liberating,1
6394,experience .,1
6395,director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz,1
6396,holding it all together .,1
6397,sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .,1
6398,the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .,1
6399,there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking .,1
6400,williams has now proven that he can play creepy with the best of them .,1
6401,"a "" home alone "" film that is staged like "" rosemary's baby",1
6402,""" but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .",1
6403,even if you don't understand what on earth is going on,1
6404,this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion,1
6405,if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .,1
6406,the movie is so contrived,1
6407,nonsensical and formulaic that,1
6408,come to think of it,1
6409,the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .,1
6410,son of the bride manages to be affectionate without drawing too deeply from a well of sugar and schmaltz .,1
6411,the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely,1
6412,relevant,1
6413,and sickeningly real .,1
6414,proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot,1
6415,expertly cast,1
6416,paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report .,1
6417,well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .,1
6418,suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle,1
6419,but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .,1
6420,bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy,1
6421,the movie . . . is,1
6422,also,1
6423,frequently hilarious .,1
6424,as in his other searingly intelligent docs,1
6425,dong presents the facts in an admirably clear-eyed way .,1
6426,beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .,1
6427,children of the century,1
6428,though well dressed and well made,1
6429,ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers .,1
6430,ao sair do cinema,1
6431,eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que,1
6432,para mim,1
6433,a existÃªncia de papai noel era um fato inquestionÃ¡vel .,1
6434,the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal .,1
6435,a strong first quarter,1
6436,slightly less so second quarter,1
6437,and average second half .,1
6438,talk to her manages to be female-centric even as it explores the lives of men .,1
6439,if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side,1
6440,that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you inÂ…and making you sweat .,1
6441,lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life,1
6442,stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness .,1
6443," "" the ring "" is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it",1
6444,and it carries the same strengths and flaws .,1
6445,an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore .,1
6446,mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .,1
6447,looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .,1
6448,it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .,1
6449,mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags,1
6450,scattered moments of lazy humor .,1
6451,while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity .,1
6452,just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .,1
6453,what emerges is not only a portrait of some of the more colorful denizens of mayport,1
6454,florida,1
6455,but also a moving examination of the power of art to transform lives .,1
6456, . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .,1
6457,it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather,1
6458,pity anyone who sees this mishmash .,1
6459,one of the film's strongest achievements is the way it manages to get so much mileage out of such a simple concept as spirals .,1
6460,in a normal screen process,1
6461,these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d,1
6462,the clichÃ©s disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .,1
6463,broomfield seems to uncover a massive scoop here,1
6464,revealing the multitude of people involved and the possible motivations behind the killings of his titular subjects .,1
6465,one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .,1
6466,it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect,1
6467,and is engrossing and moving in its own right .,1
6468,the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them,1
6469,forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .,1
6470,the plot is very clever,1
6471,but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events,1
6472,all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .,1
6473,cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer .,1
6474,we're not talking a disney treasure here,1
6475,but if treasure planet falls short of gem status,1
6476,it should provide youngsters with a reasonable amount of diversion .,1
6477,i liked the original short story but this movie,1
6478,even at an hour and twenty-some minutes,1
6479,it's too long and it goes nowhere .,1
6480,it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation,1
6481,from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks .,1
6482,the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles,1
6483,one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .,1
6484,[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen,1
6485,stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material .,1
6486,reign of fire may well be the most grim dragon movie ever made -- and it's all the more effective for the filmmakers' decision to play it straight .,1
6487,while some of the subplots are very sketchy and the motivations of some of the characters are not clear,1
6488,it is a journey worth taking because of the wondrous imagery .,1
6489,able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history .,1
6490,the film brilliantly shines on all the characters,1
6491,as the direction is intelligently accomplished .,1
6492,there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here,1
6493,but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .,1
6494,the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .,1
6495,like a tarantino movie with heart,1
6496,alias betty is richly detailed,1
6497,deftly executed and utterly absorbing .,1
6498,not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit,1
6499,but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see .,1
6500,occasionally funny,1
6501,always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodÃ³var style .,1
6502,oscar wilde's masterpiece,1
6503,the importance of being earnest,1
6504,may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless,1
6505,polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions,1
6506,but even oliver parker's movie adaptation .,1
6507,bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be .,1
6508,a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama .,1
6509,a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch .,1
6510,it's a lovely,1
6511,sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style .,1
6512,liman,1
6513,of swingers and go,1
6514,makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long,1
6515,low-heat chase,1
6516,interrupted by a middling car chase .,1
6517,a canny,1
6518,derivative,1
6519,wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists .,1
6520,woody allen's latest is an ambling,1
6521,broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .,1
6522,the far future may be awesome to consider,1
6523,but from period detail to matters of the heart,1
6524,this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .,1
6525,this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are,1
6526,and how to push them .,1
6527,was it too much to ask to have one tank blow up one dragon ? what the hell ? !,1
6528,it's sobering,1
6529,particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily,1
6530,or soon .,1
6531,a movie that will surely be profane,1
6532,politically charged music to the ears of cho's fans .,1
6533,credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic .,1
6534,the film is rich with colorful characters and enlivened by its strong,1
6535,convincing picture of rural trinidad .,1
6536,both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events,1
6537,and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day,1
6538,and of the thousands thereafter .,1
6539,true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff,1
6540,ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation .,1
6541,it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film,1
6542,because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull .,1
6543,i'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy,1
6544,' but real women have curves truly is life affirming .,1
6545,an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .,1
6546,seagal,1
6547,who looks more like danny aiello these days,1
6548,mumbles his way through the movie .,1
6549,the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife .,1
6550,it's a fascinating look into what spielberg truly loves,1
6551,but it's not so much a masterpiece as a nice milestone .,1
6552,"sum "" is jack ryan's "" do-over . "" give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck .",1
6553,"the film delivers what it promises : a look at the "" wild ride "" that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops",1
6554,cell phones and sketchy business plans .,1
6555,leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good,1
6556,but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly .,1
6557,colorful,1
6558,energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor .,1
6559,though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought,1
6560,the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .,1
6561,kids five and up will be delighted with the fast,1
6562,funny,1
6563,and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly,1
6564,because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year,1
6565,including those intended for adults .,1
6566,a fascinating examination of the joyous,1
6567,turbulent self-discovery made by a proper,1
6568,middle-aged woman .,1
6569,sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out .,1
6570,no earth-shattering accomplishment,1
6571,but an unusually smart movie that the whole family can go to without a single person getting bored or talked down to .,1
6572,a haunting,1
6573,rich film . . . [fraser] and caine blend beautifully with their sweet-and-sour mix of acting .,1
6574,the story is familiar from its many predecessors ,1
6575,like them,1
6576,it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .,1
6577,the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ?,1
6578,scotland looks wonderful,1
6579,the fans are often funny fanatics,1
6580,the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf .,1
6581,imax films can sometimes feel like a gimmick,1
6582,but this is one subject that demands a scope as big as the imagination .,1
6583,the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality,1
6584,' in all its fusty squareness .,1
6585,e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals,1
6586,14-year-old robert macnaughton,1

6588,convince us of the existence of the wise,1
6589,wizened visitor from a faraway planet .,1
6590,a depraved,1
6591,incoherent,1
6592,instantly disposable piece of hackery .,1
6593,if you want a movie time trip,1
6594,the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .,1
6595,sort of an existential version of a seinfeld episode .,1
6596,opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama,1
6597,"better suited for a movie titled "" glory : a soldier's story . """,1
6598,as the national media become more sedate and incurious,1
6599,this country desperately needs a gadfly like moore . indeed,1
6600,we need more like him .,1
6601,the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty .,1
6602,the rookie feels like baseball itself : sort of boring,1
6603,sort of stately,1
6604,yet possessed of an ineffable poetry that speaks to the young heart of old men and their sons .,1

6606,not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again .,1
6607,there's a disreputable air about the whole thing,1

6611,a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .,1
6612,most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there .,1
6613,drumline is -- the mere suggestion,1
6614,albeit a visually compelling one,1
6615,of a fully realized story .,1
6616,a witty and suspenseful tone poem with a magnetic isabelle huppert as a perverse,1
6617,central character .,1
6618,a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults,1
6619,as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats .,1
6620,a film for all who care about the world their children and grandchildren will inherit .,1
6621,the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .,1
6622,the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .,1
6623,there's a heavy stench of 'been there,1
6624,done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .,1
6625,daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story,1
6626,as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph,1
6627,as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming .,1
6628,succumbs to the same kind of maudlin,1
6629,sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies .,1
6630,life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .,1
6631,it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .,1
6632,solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision,1
6633,but that vision is beginning to feel,1
6634,if not morally bankrupt,1
6635,at least terribly monotonous .,1
6636,a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault,1

6638,this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career .,1
6639,a painting brought to life,1
6640,the tracker is an enigmatic visual essay set on a vast australian landscape .,1
6641,though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl,1
6642,rain is the far superior film .,1
6643,less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .,1
6644,talk to her is so darned assured,1
6645,we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching .,1
6646,[nesbitt's is] one of those performances that simply 'is . ',1
6647,scores by marshaling facts that speak for themselves . and they don't speak kindly .,1
6648,twohy is not only skilled at building and maintaining suspense,1
6649,he's also aware that a cast chock full of experienced character actors is the right fit for a haunted sub flick .,1
6650,effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience .,1
6651,this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now .,1
6652,as charming,1
6653,humorous and heimisch as its nomadic subjects .,1
6654,something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass,1
6655,except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .,1
6656,this is so de palma . if you love him,1
6657,you'll like it . if you don't . . . well,1
6658,skip to another review .,1
6659,windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying,1
6660,the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .,1
6661,it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba,1
6662,murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .,1
6663,it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves,1
6664,without all oedekerk's impish augmentation .,1
6665,davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces .,1
6666,the four feathers is definitely horse feathers,1

6673,frustratingly,1
6674,dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .,1
6675,boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .,1
6676,it's a more believable scenario for infidelity than most such movies,1
6677,and aniston gives her all to the role .,1
6678,you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away,1
6679,and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down .,1
6680,reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior,1
6681,it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .,1
6682,the problem is that for the most part,1
6683,the film is deadly dull .,1
6684,its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation,1
6685,which is way too stagy .,1
6686,toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ,1
6687,everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away .,1
6688,the movie is a meditation on the love and envy that russia has always felt toward europe,1
6689,and i won't pretend i got more than 30 percent of what was going on .,1

6693,poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .,1
6694,the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .,1
6695,all the performances are top notch and,1
6696,once you get through the accents,1
6697,all or nothing becomes an emotional,1
6698,though still positive,1
6699,wrench of a sit .,1
6700,what is unique about his secret life is that an assumption of intelligence,1
6701,tolerance,1
6702,and acceptance is already made,1
6703,and thus the movie can focus on telling a compelling story .,1
6704,it is compelling to be exposed to a film as bluntly honest and yet as paradoxically ordinary as last orders .,1
6705,director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .,1
6706,fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for .,1

6709,if there was a flu shot for the blues,1
6710,it might come in the form of this embraceable ode to loneliness and love regained .,1
6711,no,1
6712,it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original,1
6713,but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels .,1

6715,to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ,1
6716,it has a dull,1
6717,costumey feel .,1
6718,the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .,1
6719,the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle,1

6725,her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .,1
6726,you've seen it before : the ex-con who stumbles while striving to assimilate back into society . but writer-director joe maggio and his able cast makes you care about this man's sorry journey in virgil bliss .,1
6727,apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .,1
6728,no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham,1
6729,calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .,1

6758,williams,1
6759,and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .,1
6760,flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .,1
6761,birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in,1
6762,15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .,1

6775,a boring,1
6776,pretentious muddle that uses a sensational,1

6779,the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama,1
6780,the performances are strong,1
6781,though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .,1
6782,you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .,1
6783,a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie,1

6785,brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression .,1
6786,this movie is something of an impostor itself,1
6787,stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .,1

6789,moody male hustler in the title role,1
6790,[franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence,1
6791,but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .,1
6792, . . . while certainly clever in spots,1

6804,energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side,1
6805,but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested .,1
6806,almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided,1

7421,so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride .,1
7422,no matter how you slice it,1
7423,mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant,1
7424,two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .,1
7425,a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich .,1

7428,the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain .,1
7429,while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades .,1
7430,each story is built on a potentially interesting idea,1
7431,but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting,1
7432,while the third feels limited by its short running time .,1
7433,interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic,1
7434,and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .,1
7435,a modestly comic,1
7436,modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that,1
7437,in terms of authenticity,1
7438,is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .,1
7439,i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy,1
7440,that's a pretty big problem .,1
7441,in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment,1
7442,time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film .,1
7443,by the time you reach the finale,1
7444,you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing .,1
7445,inherently caustic and oddly whimsical,1
7446,the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .,1

7457,exhilarating and horrifying,1
7458,and sometimes all at once .,1
7459,you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes,1
7460,and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting,1
7461,the crackle of lines,1
7462,the impressive stagings of hardware,1
7463,make for some robust and scary entertainment .,1
7464,bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material,1
7465,and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches .,1
7466,the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones,1

7485,reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .,1
7486,a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs .,1
7487,it's all entertaining enough,1
7488,but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper .,1
7489,let's face it,1
7490,even vin's fake tats have more charisma than pierce brosnan .,1
7491,a distinctly mixed bag,1
7492,the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .,1
7493,superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .,1
7494,this is a finely written,1
7495,superbly acted offbeat thriller .,1
7496,if you're able to go,1
7497,relax and lower your expectations,1
7498,you might be carried away by it .,1
7499,the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing,1
7500,but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies .,1
7501,characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .,1
7502,not a film to rival to live,1
7503,but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .,1
7504,the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be .,1
7505,one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .,1
7506,die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms,1
7507,or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .,1
7508,in the end,1
7509,all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .,1
7510,the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death,1
7511,if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication .,1
7512,a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad,1
7513,soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .,1
7514,the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .,1
7515,an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud,1
7516,whose charm,1

7521,the band's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring,1
7522,especially for aging hippies ( this one included ) .,1
7523,you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .,1
7524,it may be an easy swipe to take,1
7525,but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut .,1
7526,this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee,1
7527,and it still is .,1
7528,more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports,1

7530,the film belongs to the marvelous verdu,1
7531,a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public,1

7546,ararat is among the director's best work,1
7547,a rendering of the past that offers hope for the future .,1
7548,a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .,1
7549,a terrifically deft picture about the thick line that separates movie glamour from the real world,1
7550,and the thin line between common sense and paranoia .,1
7551,a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .,1

7595,a necessary one .,1
7596,nothing short of a respectful testament to the ingenious creative drive of the outsider .,1
7597,the story,1
7598,touching though it is,1

8137,political intrigue and brushes with calamity .,1
8138,it's often faintly amusing,1

8188,the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .,1
8189,a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie .,1

8205,jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can,1
8206,but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .,1

8234,less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .,1

8272,a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides .,1
8273,this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked .,1

8316,for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life,1
8317,and its electronic expression through cyber culture,1
8318,the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time .,1

8484,montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .,1
8485,the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need,1
8486,history and presumption tangle,1
8487,and sometimes destroy,1
8488,blood ties .,1
8489,none of his actors stand out,1
8490,but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere .,1
8491,overall,1

8504,which is mostly a bore,1
8505,seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .,1
8506,to the film's credit,1
8507,the acting is fresh and unselfconscious,1
8508,and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment .,1
8509,this has to be one of the most bizarre love stories ever to be filmed,1
8510,not since nine Â½ weeks has anybody done this much pampering for his 'girlfriend' .,1
8511,ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance,1
8512,ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory,1
8513,but it's self-defeatingly decorous .,1
8514,it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past .,1
8515,the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .,1
8516,for the most part,1
8517,i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .,1
8518,it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script,1

8524,that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con,1
8525,and you're just the mark .,1
8526, a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship,1
8527,love,1
8528,and the truth that we're all in this together .,1
8529,a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps .,1
8530,where this was lazy but enjoyable,1
8531,a formula comedy redeemed by its stars,1
8532,that is even lazier and far less enjoyable .,1
8533,don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some .,1
8534,confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk .,1
8535,in the end,1
8536,the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters Â— damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .,1

8538,but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time .,1
8539,director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . .,1
8540, . . . with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically,1
8541,this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest,1

8544,adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .,1
8545,lan yu is at times too restrained,1
8546,yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree .,1
8547,becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't .,1
8548,it's all very cute,1
8549,though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old .,1
8550,johnson has,1
8551,in his first film,1
8552,set himself a task he is not nearly up to .,1
8553,the screenplay is hugely overwritten,1
8554,with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .,1
8555,ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics,1
8556,delivering a series of abrasive,1
8557,stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory .,1

8565,i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .,1
8566,feels slight,1
8567,as if it were an extended short,1
8568,albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .,1
8569,it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess,1
8570,piss on trees,1
8571,b . s . one another and put on a show in drag .,1
8572,the plot has a number of holes,1
8573,and at times it's simply baffling .,1
8574,10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .,1
8575,talkiness isn't necessarily bad,1
8576,but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .,1

8580,at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading .,1
8581,a witty screen adaptation of this classic comedy of manners with its generous supply of snappy one-liners .,1
8582, . . . the movie just might be worth a rental if only for the sight of watching christopher walken belt out a musical number using only his hand and his armpit .,1
8583,this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead,1
8584,it'll only put you to sleep .,1
8585,one of the funniest motion pictures of the year,1
8586,but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing .,1
8587,[russell] makes good b movies ( the mask,1
8588,the blob ),1
8589,and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards .,1
8590,the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .,1
8591,the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances .,1
8592,it's an exhilarating place to visit,1
8593,this laboratory of laughter .,1
8594,it's too long,1
8595,too repetitive,1
8596,and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .,1
8597,there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl .,1
8598,its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work .,1
8599,enough is not a bad movie,1
8600,just mediocre . the performances are so overstated,1
8601,the effect comes off as self-parody .,1
8602,a movie that's full of deft,1
8603,off-center observations about the world of filmmaking .,1
8604,the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks .,1
8605,it may be a prize winner,1
8606,but teacher is a bomb .,1
8607,the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming .,1
8608,it's endlessly inventive,1
8609,consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage .,1
8610,there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them .,1
8611,none of this is meaningful or memorable,1
8612,but frosting isn't,1
8613,either,1
8614,and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that,1
8615,would you ?,1
8616,unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar,1
8617,the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz .,1
8618, . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might .,1
8619,the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound,1
8620,the lack of climax and,1
8621,worst of all,1
8622,watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .,1
8623,the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann .,1
8624,far-fetched premise,1
8625,convoluted plot,1
8626,and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .,1

8629,boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy,1
8630,kinky fun .,1
8631,the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't .,1
8632,this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring,1
8633,eccentric enough to stave off doldrums,1
8634,caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .,1
8635,purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore,1
8636,if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .,1
8637,heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter nÃ¦ss' delicate,1
8638,clever direction . . . and a wonderful,1
8639,imaginative script by axel hellstenius .,1
8640,takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe,1
8641,and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .,1
8642,it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster,1
8643,anne meara,1
8644,eugene levy,1
8645,and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie .,1
8646,the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy .,1
8647,in the second half of the film,1
8648,frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis .,1
8649,trust and deceit,1

8651,what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .,1

8984,spirited away concerns a little girl learning to honour her friends and her family by valuing herself .,1
8985,time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets,1

8987,in keeping with its source material,1
8988,and new millennium hip .,1
8989,hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown,1
8990,the film nevertheless works up a few scares .,1

9005,who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .,1
9006,a resonant tale of racism,1
9007,revenge and retribution .,1
9008,visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons,1
9009,loyalty and duty .,1
9010,the movie,1
9011,despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places,1
9012,is wry and engrossing .,1
9013,it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .,1
9014,it's the most nimble epic you're likely to see .,1
9015,the action switches between past and present,1
9016,but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .,1

9035,the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining,1
9036,but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .,1
9037,this crafty little mystery/thriller deserves a wider audience -- if for no other reason than its attention to period detail,1
9038,its subtlety and its emphasis on mood .,1
9039,in the end,1
9040,egoyan's enormous talent and mychael danna's intense score keep ararat interesting and emotional .,1
9041,neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers,1

9065,unspeakable,1
9066,of course,1

9070,a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts .,1

9074,but it is a rather poor imitation .,1
9075,critics need a good laugh,1

9078,sickening,1
9079,sidesplitting goods in steaming,1
9080,visceral heaps .,1
9081,parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that,1
9082,with humor,1
9083,warmth,1
9084,and intelligence,1
9085,captures a life interestingly lived .,1
9086,maybe the title should have been confusions of a dangerous mind,1

9094,poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography,1
9095,complete with visible boom mikes .,1

9104,it is the sheer,1
9105,selfish,1
9106,wound-licking,1
9107,bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion,1
9108,despite its patchy construction .,1
9109,a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney .,1
9110,the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .,1

9150,compassion,1
9151,and forgiveness .,1
9152,harmon opts to show less and suggest more,1

9178,a beguiling,1
9179,slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran .,1
