0,"Italy has said all shops except pharmacies and food outlets will be closed in response to the country's coronavirus outbreak as the death toll from the diseasein the country jumped sharply in the last 24 hours. A top Italian doctor said intensive care wards should place an age limit on beds as a way of prioritising medical resources amid the deepening crisis that has seen cases in Italy rise by 196 to 827 today. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the latest wave of restrictions in a dramatic appeal to the nation that came as the country of 60 million battles its biggest crisis in generations. Conte said in his nine-minute evening prime time address to the nation: 'Thank you to all Italians who make sacrifices. We are proving to be a great nation.' Italians have watched ever tighter restrictions slowly eat away at the very fabric of everyday life as a government decree on Monday stopped non-essential travel between cities and banned public gatherings. The existing clampdown on public gathering and basic travel had already emptied streets and shuttered everything from churches to restaurants. In another development top doctors suggested that rather than admit patients on a 'first come first served' basis, hospitals should swap to 'catastrophe medicine' guidelines - typically used in war zones and during natural disasters - where those with the greatest chance of survival are given priority. The guidelines should apply to all patients needing intensive care treatment and not just those suffering from coronavrius, according to guidance published this week by the Society ofAnesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SAARI). If a limit on beds is implemented it could mean elderly patients with no signs of coronavirus being turfed off ICU wards to make space for younger patients who have longer left to live. It comes as total confirmed infections in Europe rose to 22,485 with 940 deaths, according to a new tally which is compiled from official sources. In Italy, the number has risen to 12,462 cases with 827 fatalities. More European countries are reporting their first deaths of people with the new contagion. The death in Sweden of an elderly woman who had been in intensive care represented the first virus-related death for the whole Nordic-Baltic region. Ireland, Belgium, Bulgaria and Albania reported their first virus-related deaths earlier on Wednesday. Denmark's Prime MinisterMette Frederiksenannounced today that the country will close all kindergartens, schools and universities for two weeks. Swiss customs authorities have shut down nine border crossings with Italy, the epicentre of Europe's coronavirus outbreak, to channel border traffic through seven other sites. The move announced today follows a decision by Italian authorities to continue to allow cross-border traffic with Switzerland despite adopting strong quarantine measures across Italy. Neighbours Austria and Slovenia have barred travellers from Italy without a medical certificate. In Italy a rise in cases of31 per cent was reported today by the Civil Protection Agency, the largest increase in absolute numbers since the contagion came to light on February 21. The total number of cases in Italy, the European country hardest hit by the virus, rose to 12,462 from a previous 10,149, an increase of 22.8 per cent. However, the agency said some 600 new cases were confirmed on Tuesday but only reported on Wednesday. The head of the agency said that, of those originally infected, 1,045 had fully recovered compared to 1,004 the day before. Some 1,028 people were in intensive care against a previous 877. Italy announced 200 deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday in the largest daily rise yet, as infections spiked to more than 12,000. Medics have warned that the UK and US are approximately two weeks away from facing the same scenario. The entirety of Italy has since been placed on lockdown, with medics in badly-hit regions saying they are struggling to cope with a huge spike in patients. In a booklet on coronavirus published on Friday, SAARI lays out its recommendations for a worst-case scenario. While all efforts should be taken to ensure everyone gets care, doctors say it is likely that multiple hospital will be stretched beyond their limits 'in the next few weeks'. Around 10 per cent of coronavirus cases in Italy have so far developed serious complications, they note, requiring extensive treatment with ventilators which are in short supply. In the event that they run out, SAARI says: 'It may be necessary to place an age limit on admission to intensive care. 'This is not a value judgment but a way to provide extremely scarce resources to those who have the highest likelihood of survival and could enjoy the largest number of life-years saved.' Doctors should also take into account how many other conditions patients are suffering from when deciding whether or not they deserve access to intensive care, medics say, and not simply base their judgement on age. They warn that this will lead to an increase in deaths from people who are not suffering directly from the virus, but who can no longer be treated. The guidelines have not yet been adopted, but provide a blueprint of what Italy could do should the situation spiral out of control further. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization officially declared coronavirus a pandemic after the number of patients struck down by the killer infection across the world surpassed 112,000 and the death toll neared 4,500. The boss of the UN agency said it was 'deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity', with outbreaks continuing to spiral out of control. Dr Tedros Adhanom also warned inaction by governments across the planet has fuelled the crisis, adding: 'We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action.' In a desperate call to action to contain the escalating crisis, he said: 'We're in this together, to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It's doable.' A pandemic is defined as the uncontrolled worldwide spread of a new disease – the last crisis to be given the official label was the 2009 swine flu outbreak, which killed hundreds of thousands of people. More than 112,000 people globally have now been infected with the coronavirus, which can cause pneumonia and shut down crucial internal organs. The crisis in China, where the outbreak began, has slowed dramatically. Europe is now the centre of the crisis, with the number of cases soaring every day in Italy – where all 60million residents have been affected by an unprecedented lockdown. Outbreaks are also growing in Spain, France, Germany and the UK. Britons have been told to leave Italy and go home as the country shuts down everything in a drastic bid to stop a coronavirus outbreak. The nation is grappling with the worst epidemic in the world outside China and more than 10,000 people have now caught the infection there. 631 have died. The UK Foreign Office today urged British people to fly home while they still can as the Italian government urges tourists to leave and airlines are cancelling flights. In a statement officials said: 'The Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should end their travel, unless it is necessary, to return to the place where they live.' Plane tickets out of Italy are quickly becoming hot property after British Airways, Easyjet, Jet2 and WizzAir cancelled all of their routes between Italy and the UK. Ryanair is flying normally until Saturday, when it will stop for almost a month, and Easyjet said it would operate 'rescue flights' in the coming days. One couple from Hertfordshire spent £600 in their desperate bid to get out of the country, driving through the night from Milan to Turin to ensure a seat to London. Others who have returned in the last 24 hours said the situation was nowhere near this bad when they left and many now face two weeks in isolation at home in case they've caught the coronavirus. A statement from the Foreign Office today said: 'British nationals remain able to depart Italy without restriction. 'Airports remain open throughout Italy. However, the Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should end their travel, unless it is necessary, to return to the place where they live. 'Airline schedules are subject to change and some flights are being cancelled. 'We therefore advise all remaining British tourists in Italy to contact their airline operators to arrange return to the UK as soon as possible.'",0
1,"Boris Johnsonwas accused of 'playing roulette' with people's lives and being too slow to react to the coronavirus outbreak hours before two more people died in the UK today, bringing the country's death toll to eight. The Prime Minister will chair an emergency Cobra meeting tomorrow, where it is expected that the UK will make the formal switch to 'delaying' the spread of the bug as the Government rolls out its battle plan. He is also expected to meet with Labour figures to brief them on planned emergency laws, such as closing schools, banning large public gatherings, and instructing millions of employees to work from home. Richard Horton, chief editor of the prestigious Lancet medical journal, blasted the Government's dithering, saying:'The UK Government - Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson - claim they are following the science. 'But that is not true. The evidence is clear.We need urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies. The Government is playing roulette with the public. This is a major error.' His incendiary allegations follow news of the death of two coronavirus patients. One victim was a woman in her 70s with underlying health problems from Dudley, West Midlands. The second was an 'elderly patient' with a number of chronic conditions at the George Eliot Hospital in Warwickshire. Britain also suffered its highest spike in cases in a single day amid fears Britain is hurtling towards an Italy-style crisis. Infections soared to 458, up by 85 in a 24-hour period,meaning the outbreak has risen five-fold in a week. Meanwhile, more than 100 Britons who were stranded on board the Grand Princess cruise liner off the coast of San Francisco due to coronavirus fears landed in Birmingham Airport to begin self-isolation at home. It comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the crisis a global pandemicafter an 'alarming spread and severity' of cases across the globe. However, UK ministers have - so far - stoppedshort of shifting the official strategy from the 'contain' phase, claiming that 'scientific advice' suggests the draconian measures are not yet necessary. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs tonight that Parliament would not close, despite a senior minister being diagnosed with the disease, sending a shockwave through Westminster. After Nadine Dorries revealed she was self-isolating, Mr Hancock told the Commons:'Of course, in some ways this House may have to function differently, but the ability to hold the Government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times - our democracy is the foundation of our way of life. 'The public will expect Parliament to sit and get on with its job.' The World Health Organisation's (WHO) decision to upgrade the outbreak to a pandemic tonight will heap more pressure on the Prime Minister to reconsider Britain's public health strategy. In a veiled jab at the UK, WHO's director general Dr Tedros Adhanom slammed countries for failing to halt the spread quicker.He said that while some countries did not have robust enough healthcare systems to deal with the crisis, others were simply 'struggling with a lack of resolve'. Most of the cases confirmed in the UK have been in England (387). Thirty six patients have been struck down in Scotland, 16 in Northern Ireland and 19 in Wales. Dozens are feared to have caught the infection within the UK. In other developments in Britain's battle against coronavirus crisis: It comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak today unveiled a massive £30billion plan to try and contain the crisis, while insisting the government will do 'everything it can' to keep the country 'healthy and financially secure'. Senior health officials said yesterday the peak of coronavirus in the UK is expected within the next fortnight and warned that thousands more will be infected now the virus is rapidly spreading on British soil. The infection is now transmitting between humans in 30 countries across Europe, including Spain, Germany and France – popular Easter holiday destinations for thousands of Brits looking to jet abroad. Before today, the biggest daily jump in coronavirus cases was on Sunday, March 8, when 67 patients were struck down with the killer infection, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December. But China's outbreak – which saw hundreds of millions of residents and tourists locked down to contain the spread – has dramatically slowed down in the past few weeks. Just 24 cases were diagnosed today throughout the whole of China, which is home to 1.4billion people. During its peak in early February, almost 4,000 patients were being diagnosed each day. However, the coronavirus crisis is continuing to spiral rapidly in Europe, with Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, France, Spain and Italy having recorded more cases than the UK. Mr Sunak unveiled a massive £30billion plan to stop coronavirus plunging Britain into Italy-style chaos - the worst-hit country outside of China - where over 10,000 people have come down with the illness and 631 have died. Delivering his crucial first Budget today, the Chancellor admitted that people were 'worried' and the killer disease will inevitably have a major impact on the economy.The NHS and other public services will get a £5billion emergency response fund, with Mr Sunak vowing he 'will go further if necessary'. In a huge £2billion bailout, ministers are footing the sick pay bill for up to two million small and medium sized businesses, covering the 14 days of a quarantine period.  In a stirring message to the country, Mr Sunak said: 'We will get through this together. The British people may be worried but they are not daunted... this virus is the key challenge facing our country today.' The Chancellor added: 'It's going to be tough but I'm confident that our economic performance will recover.' His Budget comes in the shadow of mounting global turmoil over coronavirus, with Italy effectively in lockdown and the risk that the situation could spiral out of control across the rest of Europe. In other news, the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK was dramatically brought home to politicians overnight as health minister Nadine Dorries became the first MP to test positive, days after attending a reception at No10 with Boris Johnson. The PM has insisted he does not need to be tested as he has no symptoms, and was not within two metres of his minister at Downing Street reception to mark International Women's Day last Thursday, which was also attended by Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss. However, Ms Dorries' coronavirus diagnosis has caused chaos in Parliament today. Today her parliamentary office in the Norman Shaw North building close to Whitehall and her ministerial office in the Palace of Westminster are both sealed off, MailOnline can reveal. An MP and a member of staff fell ill with the virus in the wake of Ms Dorries' announcement, and some are thought to have stayed away from the set-piece today amid fears of contagion in the packed chamber. Health minister Nadine Dorries' coronavirus diagnosis has caused chaos in Parliament today as her two offices were sealed off and one of herstaff fell ill, MailOnline can reveal. Ms Dorries, 62, who began feeling ill on Friday,has said one of her office workers has 'gone down' with the killer illness and the Tory MP is now in self-isolation for the next fortnight at home in Gloucestershire. This morning she came to the bay window at the front of the sprawling house in the village of Dumbleton and told MailOnline: 'I am Nadine Dorries but don't come too close, I've got the coronavirus. I'm self isolating.' Over the weekend she experienced the 'classic symptoms' of the disease – a dry cough, high temperature and 'vice-like' pain in her chest - and tested positive yesterday. Labour's Rachael Maskell met Ms Dorries, who is Minister for Patient Safety, Suicide Prevention and Mental Health, today became the first MP to self-isolate for 14 days after she had a meeting with Ms Dorries last Thursday. Ms Dorries' symptoms began on March 6, however, the 14-day incubation period means she could have been first exposed to coronavirus on February 21 and met hundreds of people at meetings in Westminster and in her constituency before she felt poorly. Today her parliamentary officein the Norman Shaw North building close to Whitehall and her ministerial office in the Palace of Westminster are both sealed off - as are some corridors leading to them - after the MP and a member of staff fell ill with the virus that has killed six so far in Britain and 4,300 globally. There is now a mad scramble in Westminster to trace her movements and find who she met or came close to since late February - but Ms Dorries has admitted she is struggling to remember herself. She is a regular in the Commons tea room, library and is a known user of the Portcullis House canteen used by all staff based at Parliament. The Conservative MP for Mid-Bedfordshire sent a message to the Tory MP WhatsApp group this morning asking them to come forward if they were near her in Parliament because it is 'hard to remember everyone'. She told colleagues: 'My staff member has gone down with it too. I haven't yet given a list to the contact tracers. If you sat next to me in the tea room or library etc please let me know'.

It isnot known if fellow Department of Health ministers, including Health Secretary Matt Hancock, will be tested. As a junior minister, Ms Dorries does not attend cabinet or Cobra meetings. Ms Dorries appeared at the despatch box in the Commons last Wednesday but while the Commons is cleaned every day it has not had a deep clean ahead of today's budget. The chamber was quite full but there were a few gaps on one of the biggest days in the British political calendar. Today it emerged that Parliament could could sit with skeleton staff and just 100 MPs in the Commons to avoid spreading coronavirus if the crisis gets worse. But a UK parliament spokesman said this morning 'there are no plans to suspend Parliament'. Westminster staff were busy installing 300-plus hand sanitizer dispensers this afternoon. In the face of the global challenge posed by COVID-19, which has killed 4,300 globally, the Bank of England this morning slashed its key interest rate by half a per cent to 0.25 per cent. The cut will drive down the cost of borrowing for millions of households and businesses, giving them breathing space if the economy slows down. It is the first cut since August 2016 and the first unplanned rates decision since the 2008 financial crisis. The FTSE 100 index reacted by rising 124 points or 2.1 per cent to 6,084 at the open this morning, before trading down at 31 points or 0.53 per cent to 5,929, by 1pm. The Bank said it must help UK businesses and households through an economic shock from the virus 'that could prove sharp and large, but should be temporary'. At a press conference following the rate cut, Bank Governor Mark Carney said the measures announced will 'prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer lasting economic harm'. Incoming Governor Andrew Bailey said it was too early to forecast what the economic hit of the outbreak will be in the UK, but warned it could be 'large and sharp'. He said there was 'no reason that this shock should turn into the situation of 2008... if we handle it well'. As the death toll on UK soil remains at six so far, a British woman was announced to have died of coronavirus in Indonesia, becoming the country's first death in the epidemic. The government said the 53-year-old woman with diabetes and lung disease had died in hospital after being admitted in a critical condition.Reports in Indonesia say she was cremated today. UK officials have not confirmed her cause of death, but the Indonesian government says she had tested positive for coronavirus. She is believed to have picked up the virus outside the country, which so far has 27 cases. A Foreign Office spokesman did not say where the woman was or in what hospital or city she had died. However, reports in Indonesia say that the woman was being treated at the Sanglah General Hospital on the island and was cremated atthe Mumbul crematorium on the island. A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office said it was supporting her family. Her husband was also in Indonesia and is due to return to Britain soon, officials say. The jump in cases in Britain today raise fears that coronavirus is spreading between people - as thefirst case of community transmission of coronavirus in Scotland was today confirmed by the country's chief medical officer. Britons travelling back to the UK from coronavirus-ravaged Italy have criticised the Government for doing next to nothing to stop them potentially spreading the killer virus in Britain. Denise Owens, who returned from Venice last night after a holiday with her husband, said there had been signs of precautions being taken but they were not followed through. She told MailOnline: 'While on the plane we all had to fill out forms so they could trace all passengers if one became ill. I went to hand mine in on the plane but was told we had to hand them in inside the airport, but there was no-one to give these forms to. Nobody was interested. Mine is still in my bag.' Another family who visited the north of Italy during February half-term said they were told they didn't need to self-isolate when they came home. Silvia Monchelato and her family, who have lived in London for 15 years, returned in the same week that Italy's rampant outbreak started to spiral out of control. They were told by NHS 111 that they did not need to isolate, she told MailOnline, but she and her son were taken into quarantine when he started to feel ill – but her daughter was sent back to school. Mrs Monchelato, who is Italian but has had both her children in the UK, said:'The measures that the British government is taking are not at all logical, consistent or protective.' Engineer Anna De Luca, 30, who lives in Brighton and arrived at Gatwick yesterday, said: 'There were no checks at all. So I said, I will take some responsibility and wear the mask - even if it's useless. 'But even in Naples they did a check, and told us to stay one metre away from the next person. And then on the plane there was nothing. We weren't given any information. 'I just asked a man working here, he said maybe you should phone 111, but there were no checks at all.' Carmine Loru, 39, who arrived at Gatwick on a flight from Florence, said that he had been given no information about self-isolation. Mr Loru, whose family live in Florence, said: 'There is a lot of paranoia in Italy, but here there is not even anybody checking us. 'I read on the BBC that I'm supposed to stay at home for 14 days, but nobody said anything about that on the plane. In Florence they didn't tell us anything about what to do in London.' Many of the UK's 458 cases have been among recent visitors to Italy or from people who caught it inside the UK since Italy's outbreak began. However, people travelling back to the UK from coronavirus-hit Italy have today said the Government is doing next to nothing to protect against them spreading the virus in Britain. A couple flying into London from Venice last night said they were given forms to fill out in case health officials had to track them down if a passenger was diagnosed, but nobody collected the forms. And a family who returned from northern Italy in half-term were reportedly told they did not need to self-isolate but, when one of them fell ill, only two of them were quarantined in a hospital to wait for test results which were eventually negative. The travellers' stories are some of many from people returning from Italy who say they are confused and frustrated by the Government's travel advice. People have also been surprised to find they are still able to travel as normal, facing no health checks or questioning at the British border. The UK Foreign Office is now advising everyone returning from Italy to isolate themselves at home for two weeks in case they caught the coronavirus there. A further135 Britons landing in the UK today from the coronavirus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship have also been told to self isolate for two weeks, and will not be formally quarantined. This is despite being in close proximity to the 21 passengers and crew who have tested positive for coronavirus on the ship on March 4, when all passengers were forced to remain in their cabins to prevent further spread while the cruise-liner sat in limbo of the Californian coast. The evacuees are expected to land at Birmingham Airport later today after RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and Boscombe Down in Wiltshire, where previous repatriated Britons have been quarantined, were vetoed. Transport organised by Carnival Cruises will bring them to their individual homes where they have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case of Covid-19 infection. They have been told to only get in touch with the NHS if they fall ill - despite the fact infected patients are highly contagious a week before showing symptoms. 'The British nationals returning from the Grand Princess cruise ship will be asked to self-isolate at home and followed up on by PHE on a daily basis as a precautionary approach,' said Public Health England. British passengers with symptoms did not board the plane and were taken to a hospital in San Francisco instead and there are still seven British crew members remaining on the ship. American passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship have been flown to military bases to be kept in quarantine for 14 days where they will be tested. A British woman has died of coronavirus in Indonesia after picking up the virus elsewhere, becoming the country's first death in the epidemic. Indonesia's government said the 53-year-old woman with diabetes and lung disease had died in hospital after being admitted in a critical condition. UK officials have not confirmed her cause of death, but the Indonesian government says she had tested positive for coronavirus. A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office said it was supporting her family. The spokesman did not say where the woman was or in what hospital or city she had died. However, reports in Indonesia say that the woman was being treated at the Sanglah General Hospital on the island. Reports in Indonesia say she was cremated today. Her husband was also in Indonesia and is due to return to Britain soon, officials say. While the infection is now transmitting between humans in at least 30 countries across Europe, according to the World Health Organization, football games have been widely suspended. All domestic football in Italy has been suspended until April 3, matches in France will be played without a maximum of 1,000 spectators until April 16 and games in Spain held behind closed doors for at least two weeks. But Premier League football matches are expected to take place as normal this weekend despite fears over the spread of coronavirus in Britain. Only tonight's Manchester City v Arsenal match has been postponed after Nottingham Forest and Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis contracted coronavirus and visited the London club's Emirates Stadium on February 27. However the Premier League has so far insisted it has no plans to postpone any other matches and 'all necessary measures are being taken', with Arsenal's visit to Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday still set to go ahead. Premier League clubs have held talks with broadcasters about streaming live matches free of charge if ordered to stage games behind closed doors by the Government, but there are currently no plans to restrict crowds. However, contingency plans are being put in place should Public Health England change its advice, with clubs asking to be given as much notice as possible if they are going to be asked to postpone or cancel games. This is war. Make no mistake, for my generation, the COVID-19 coronavirus is the biggest threat to civilian life that we will have experienced since World War 2. The disease has smashed its way out of China, where it started, and begun to wreak deadly havoc all over the globe. And it represents a particularly dangerous enemy because we still don't know exactly what we're dealing with, or how bad things are going to get. But what we DO know from what has been happening in China, South Korea, Iran and now Italy is that it has the potential to be utterly devastating. And unlike a traditional foe, this is not something we can 'defy' with conventional weapons. It's a virus, so if you come into contact with it, then it doesn't matter how big or tough you are, you will get infected. In fact, it's estimated that 80 percent of the entire planet may end up being infected by this coronavirus. Most, especially the very young and healthy, should emerge relatively unscathed. But for older people, and those with underlying health issues, COVID-19 is a very serious virus. For a whole country as big as Italy to be completely locked down is unprecedented, yet the statistics that led to it explain why the Italian government has taken such dramatic steps. More than 10,000 Italians have tested positive for the virus, of whom 631 have died. This represents a mortality rate of over six percent, which is six times higher than normal flu. And the rate of infection, and deaths, in Italy has been terrifyingly fast. Just two weeks ago, it had just a few dozen cases. Now, all 60 million people in Italy are in quarantine, cut off from the rest of the world. As one leading Italian scientist said last night: 'It's like a massive bomb suddenly exploded.' Experts now fear that bomb is heading to many other places, including the US and the UK, which are both on virtually identical infection rate trajectories as Italy. The governments of both countries have so far resisted doing much more than tell people to wash their hands (this is good advice) and slash interest rates to prop up collapsing economies. President Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson seem determined to hang on as long as possible before taking the kind of draconian action Italy has taken, for reasons that frankly bemuse and concern me. What more do they need to see happen before they realize the scale of this threat and the vital need to get ahead of it? It seems insane to me that huge events like the Cheltenham racing festival in Britain have been allowed to go ahead today, meaning 250,000 people will be rubbing up against each other in very close proximity. How does this make any sense when in Italy, all live sport has been cancelled for a month? In the States, only now are presidential candidates starting to cancel rallies, but many other large gatherings of the public, including huge sports events, are still happening. To which I ask: why? We know from countries like China, albeit very late in their case, and Taiwan (which has had very few cases so far) that the key to reducing the impact of COVID-19 is to 'flatten the curve' by postponing the number of cases as long as possible to ensure victims can get the right treatment. The lower the strain on health services, the lower the mortality rate. The best way to do this is social distancing, keeping infected people away from those who are infected. Yet at the moment, we're still gathering in vast numbers for non-essential reasons. I love sport as much as anyone, but my football team Arsenal has had its Premier League match against Manchester City tonight postponed because the owner of Greek side Olympiakos, who we played 12 days ago, has tested positive for COVID-19. So why is Cheltenham going ahead given there is an almost certain chance that infected people will be among the crowds? And why is the British Parliament still in session today given that one of its members has tested positive for coronavirus? There is no consistency to the coronavirus defence by either government. It's like they are sticking their heads in the sand and hoping to dodge a bullet. But America and Britain won't dodge a bullet. Both countries have rapidly expanding infection rates, and we know for an absolute cast iron certainty these rates will now massively accelerate very quickly. So, the cold hard truth is that the coronavirus genie is out of the bottle now and no amount of money can stop it. And I dread to think what's going to happen when the US and UK health services suddenly come under the kind of intense pressure currently being seen in Italy, which has a very good health care system but is now crippling at the seams. I just hope and pray those charged with protecting our health and safety know what they're doing and making the right decisions. But there's one thing we can ALL do and that's get a collective grip, stop over-reacting and UNDER-reacting – which can even more irresponsible - and adopt a wartime mentality. That means making sacrifices. In many ways, we're the most self-absorbed generation ever to walk the earth despite, or perhaps because, most statistics on things like health, war, poverty, social mobility indicate there's never been a healthier, safer, more prosperous time to be alive. This has bred a complacency that is now about to be sorely tested. To put it bluntly, we're all going to have stop being so bloody selfish. I've been disgusted to see so many younger people on social media saying things like 'Stop scare-mongering! It only kills the elderly and sick!' as if somehow we don't need to care for the most vulnerable people in our society because we're alright, Jack. It's not about us, the younger (I'm 54, so only just about qualify for this category in coronavirus terms) people who should be OK. It's about the very people being so casually and callously dismissed – the elderly and sick. If Italy's infection and mortality rates spread to the US and UK, then hundreds of thousands, possibly, god forbid, millions, of people in those groups are going to die. The virus, as it did in China and Italy, is now spreading exponentially through both countries, mostly silently with many carriers not knowing they're infected. There seems little doubt our COVID-19 bombs are about to explode. So, let's stop the 'stop scare-mongering' bullsh*t. There are very real reasons to feel extremely concerned about this. But let's not panic either. What is needed now, just as it was in WW2, is calm heads, common-sense behavior and stoicism. I can understand why people feel the need to stock up on basic essentials, given many of us will inevitably have to self-isolate. But it is stunningly stupid, and grotesquely selfish, to see so many people still buying up masks in stores, despite being told they make no difference to the risk of infection, and despite being told it may deprive the health workers who need them most from having them. Just as it is repulsive to hear so many moaning about possibly having to forego their trips to the football, cinema, ski slopes or favorite restaurant for a few weeks or months. Are your elderly loved ones not worth skipping a movie? No, we're all going to have to make sacrifices for a bit. If that means postponing holidays, missing some sport, or drinking at home rather than the pub, then so be it. What the hell do you think our grandparents had to do during the war? Did they moan and sulk, and throw their pampered little toys out of the pram? No, they stiffened their lips, cracked on, and put the national interest above their own personal comfort. I can't believe we're still even debating whether to still hold major international sporting events this summer like the European Football Championships and Olympics. There's no chance of coronavirus blowing out before then, and it's hard to imagine anything dumber than inviting people from COVID-19 ravaged countries all over the world to all come together to watch athletes jump over bars or kick a ball. So, postpone them now and give everyone time to make other plans. The bottom line is this: life's going to get rough for a bit, as rough as most of us have known, and a lot of people are going to get seriously ill or die. But if we come together, act sensibly, put the health of others before our own selfish pursuit of pleasure, and show some gritty resolve, then we will come through it. It won't be easy, but it's the right thing to do. It's time for the kind of Bulldog spirit personified by Winston Churchill. 'If you're going through hell, keep going,' he urged as the Nazis blitzed allied forces. But it's another of his quotes that seems more pertinent now: 'Things are not always right because they are hard, but if they are right one must not mind if they are also hard.' So, stop your bloody whining and do the right thing. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 4,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 110,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 – possibly 9,700 – were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 – doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests – caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. There is now evidence that it can spread third hand – to someone from a person who caught it from another person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak is an epidemic, which is when a disease takes hold of one community such as a country or region. Although it has spread to dozens of countries, the outbreak is not yet classed as a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. The head of WHO's global infectious hazard preparedness, Dr Sylvie Briand, said: 'Currently we are not in a pandemic. We are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci, and we try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci,' the Guardian reported. She said that most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.",0
2,"This is war. Make no mistake, for my generation, the COVID-19 coronavirus is the biggest threat to civilian life that we will have experienced since World War 2. The disease has smashed its way out of China, where it started, and begun to wreak deadly havoc all over the globe. And it represents a particularly dangerous enemy because we still don’t know exactly what we’re dealing with, or how bad things are going to get. But what we DO know from what has been happening in China, South Korea, Iran and now Italy is that it has the potential to be utterly devastating. And unlike a traditional foe, this is not something we can ‘defy’ with conventional weapons. It’s a virus, so if you come into contact with it, then it doesn’t matter how big or tough you are, you will get infected. In fact, it’s estimated that 80 percent of the entire planet may end up being infected by this coronavirus. Most, especially the very young and healthy, should emerge relatively unscathed. But for older people, and those with underlying health issues, COVID-19 is a very serious virus. For a whole country as big as Italy to be completely locked down is unprecedented, yet the statistics that led to it explain why the Italian government has taken such dramatic steps. More than 10,000 Italians have tested positive for the virus, of whom 631 have died. This represents a mortality rate of over six percent, which is six times higher than normal flu. And the rate of infection, and deaths, in Italy has been terrifyingly fast. Just two weeks ago, it had just a few dozen cases. Now, all 60 million people in Italy are in quarantine, cut off from the rest of the world. As one leading Italian scientist said last night: ‘It’s like a massive bomb suddenly exploded.’ Experts now fear that bomb is heading to many other places, including the US and the UK, which are both on virtually identical infection rate trajectories as Italy. The governments of both countries have so far resisted doing much more than tell people to wash their hands (this is good advice) and slash interest rates to prop up collapsing economies. President Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson seem determined to hang on as long as possible before taking the kind of draconian action Italy has taken, for reasons that frankly bemuse and concern me. What more do they need to see happen before they realize the scale of this threat and the vital need to get ahead of it? It seems insane to me that huge events like the Cheltenham racing festival in Britain have been allowed to go ahead today, meaning 250,000 people will be rubbing up against each other in very close proximity. How does this make any sense when in Italy, all live sport has been cancelled for a month? In the States, only now are presidential candidates starting to cancel rallies, but many other large gatherings of the public, including huge sports events, are still happening. To which I ask: why? We know from countries like China, albeit very late in their case, and Taiwan (which has had very few cases so far) that the key to reducing the impact of COVID-19 is to ‘flatten the curve’ by postponing the number of cases as long as possible to ensure victims can get the right treatment. The lower the strain on health services, the lower the mortality rate. The best way to do this is social distancing, keeping infected people away from those who are infected. Yet at the moment, we’re still gathering in vast numbers for non-essential reasons. I love sport as much as anyone, but my football team Arsenal has had its Premier League match against Manchester City tonight postponed because the owner of Greek side Olympiakos, who we played 12 days ago, has tested positive for COVID-19. So why is Cheltenham going ahead given there is an almost certain chance that infected people will be among the crowds? And why is the British Parliament still in session today given that one of its members has tested positive for coronavirus? There is no consistency to the coronavirus defence by either government. It’s like they are sticking their heads in the sand and hoping to dodge a bullet. But America and Britain won’t dodge a bullet. Both countries have rapidly expanding infection rates, and we know for an absolute cast iron certainty these rates will now massively accelerate very quickly. So, the cold hard truth is that the coronavirus genie is out of the bottle now and no amount of money can stop it. And I dread to think what’s going to happen when the US and UK health services suddenly come under the kind of intense pressure currently being seen in Italy, which has a very good health care system but is now crippling at the seams. I just hope and pray those charged with protecting our health and safety know what they’re doing and making the right decisions. But there’s one thing we can ALL do and that’s get a collective grip, stop over-reacting and UNDER-reacting – which can even more irresponsible - and adopt a wartime mentality. That means making sacrifices. In many ways, we’re the most self-absorbed generation ever to walk the earth despite, or perhaps because, most statistics on things like health, war, poverty, social mobility indicate there’s never been a healthier, safer, more prosperous time to be alive. This has bred a complacency that is now about to be sorely tested. To put it bluntly, we’re all going to have stop being so bloody selfish. I’ve been disgusted to see so many younger people on social media saying things like ‘Stop scare-mongering! It only kills the elderly and sick!’ as if somehow we don’t need to care for the most vulnerable people in our society because we’re alright, Jack. It’s not about us, the younger (I’m 54, so only just about qualify for this category in coronavirus terms) people who should be OK. It’s about the very people being so casually and callously dismissed – the elderly and sick. If Italy’s infection and mortality rates spread to the US and UK, then hundreds of thousands, possibly, god forbid, millions, of people in those groups are going to die. The virus, as it did in China and Italy, is now spreading exponentially through both countries, mostly silently with many carriers not knowing they’re infected. There seems little doubt our COVID-19 bombs are about to explode. So, let’s stop the ‘stop scare-mongering’ bullsh*t. There are very real reasons to feel extremely concerned about this. But let’s not panic either. What is needed now, just as it was in WW2, is calm heads, common-sense behavior and stoicism. I can understand why people feel the need to stock up on basic essentials, given many of us will inevitably have to self-isolate. But it is stunningly stupid, and grotesquely selfish, to see so many people still buying up masks in stores, despite being told they make no difference to the risk of infection, and despite being told it may deprive the health workers who need them most from having them. Just as it is repulsive to hear so many moaning about possibly having to forego their trips to the football, cinema, ski slopes or favorite restaurant for a few weeks or months. Are your elderly loved ones not worth skipping a movie? No, we’re all going to have to make sacrifices for a bit. If that means postponing holidays, missing some sport, or drinking at home rather than the pub, then so be it. What the hell do you think our grandparents had to do during the war?  Did they moan and sulk, and throw their pampered little toys out of the pram? No, they stiffened their lips, cracked on, and put the national interest above their own personal comfort.

3,"X-ray images and CT scans including those of a Chinese man, 44, who died from coronavirus show how the disease ravages its victims' lungs. The scans show white patches in the lower corners of the lungs which indicates what radiologists call ground glass opacity - the partial filling of air spaces. Such abnormalities identified by doctors in the scans of coronavirus patients are similar to those found in patients suffering from SARS and MERS. The shocking chest X-ray of one coronavirus victim, a 44-year-old manwho worked at the Wuhan seafood market thought to be the origin of the outbreak, clearly show the ground glass opacity abnormality. The scans, released by theRadiological Society of North America, show how thefluid in the spaces of the man's lungs became more pronounced over time, as evident when comparing image A to image F. The man was admitted to hospital on December 25, 2019 after suffering from a fever and cough for almost two weeks. Doctors diagnosed the man withpneumonia andacute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite being treated by doctors, he died a week later. TheCT scans of a 54-year-old woman who caught the coronavirus after travelling to Wuhan, China, show the same partial filling of air spaces. The woman was diagnosed with severe pneumonia caused by the virus after suffering froma fever, cough, fatigue and chest congestion for a week, and she was given oxygen and antibiotics. The scan of a 45-year-old woman from Sichuan Province in China who tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from Japan showswhite patches and a 'reversed halo sign' in the left upper lobe of her lung. The extended white patches seen in the scans were also identified with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Both are also classified as coronaviruses and SARS resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths in China from November 2002 to July 2003. The most common way to identify coronavirus is to take swabs of saliva or mucus from a patient's nose or mouth or alternatively testing phlegm they produce. Yet the test is only effective when the patient is showing symptoms. The World Health Organization has today officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemicafter the number of patients struck down by the life-threatening infection across the world surpassed 112,000 and the death toll neared 4,500. The death toll from the outbreak in Italy has jumped in the last 24 hours by 196 to 827. The total number of cases in Italy, the European country hardest hit by the virus, rose to 12,462 from a previous 10,149, an increase of 22.8 per cent. Eight Britons have so far died from the virus. Thenumber of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 on Wednesday, including a minister in the health department. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned tougher measures to contain the spread of the virus were likely in the coming weeks.",0
4,"Britons have been told to leave Italy and go home as the country shuts down everything in a drastic bid to stop a coronavirus outbreak. The nation is grappling with the worst epidemic in the world outside China and more than 10,000 people have now caught the infection there. 631 have died. The UK Foreign Office today urged British people to fly home while they still can as the Italian government urges tourists to leave and airlines are cancelling flights. In a statement officials said: 'The Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should end their travel, unless it is necessary, to return to the place where they live.' Plane tickets out of Italy are quickly becoming hot property after British Airways, Easyjet, Jet2 and WizzAir cancelled all of their routes between Italy and the UK. Ryanair is flying normally until Saturday, when it will stop for almost a month, and Easyjet said it would operate 'rescue flights' in the coming days. One couple from Hertfordshire spent £600 in their desperate bid to get out of the country, driving through the night from Milan to Turin to ensure a seat to London. Others who have returned in the last 24 hours said the situation was nowhere near this bad when they left and many now face two weeks in isolation at home in case they've caught the coronavirus. A statement from the Foreign Office today said: 'British nationals remain able to depart Italy without restriction. 'Airports remain open throughout Italy. However, the Italian authorities have advised against travel for tourism purposes throughout Italy, and that tourists already on holiday in Italy should end their travel, unless it is necessary, to return to the place where they live. 'Airline schedules are subject to change and some flights are being cancelled. 'We therefore advise all remaining British tourists in Italy to contact their airline operators to arrange return to the UK as soon as possible.' Numerous airlines have cancelled flights and Ryanair, one of the last remaining British fliers, will stop its service from Saturday. Britons must now abandon their holidays and try to get a seat on one of the last flights home. WHAT DO I DO IF I'M TRAPPED IN ITALY? Ryanair is guaranteeing that all its customers in Italy can get a flight home before they stop going there on Saturday until early April. Other airlines such as BA may also choose to send empty planes to Italy to evacuate passengers whose flights were cancelled. The UK Government could also send planes like the ones used to repatriate people from China last month. CAN PEOPLE STILL FLY HOME FROM ITALY TO THE UK? Although a number of airlines, including British Airways, easyJet, Jet2 and WizzAir have cancelled some or all of their flights to and from Italy, Britons in the country can still fly home directly. Ryanair will continue to fly as normal until Saturday - with customers in Italy able to fly home before then if required. EasyJet has cancelled its flights to and from Italy for approximately a month.  Spanish airline Vuelling is running some flights. Italian airline Alitalia has stopped flying out of Milan Malpensa and limited flights from Milan Linate to only domestic routes, but it continues to fly internationally out of Rome.  CAN PEOPLE TRAVEL OUT OF ITALY BY ROAD OR RAIL? Austria has banned Italians from crossing its border but trains continue to run between the two countries. Staff are reportedly getting off at the border crossings and turning back. Switzerland's border is open and trains are still running, although Italian citizens face more detailed checks when passing into the country – they will be expected to produce work permits. Slovenia has closed its border for all non-commercial traffic. France's border remains open. The border with Croatia is also still open and authorities said they would not close it unless it was decided by the EU. But people arriving from the virus-hit north could face two weeks of quarantine. WHAT DOES ITALY'S LOCKDOWN MEAN FOR ITALIANS? Italian citizens are being urged not to travel around the country unless in emergencies, and are being prevented from flying abroad. Checkpoints on roads and at terminals will reportedly be checking people's paperwork to work out if they have good enough reasons to travel. Public trains and buses will continue to run, although people are being urged not to use them unless they have to, and no airports have been closed yet. Sam and Mark McVey, from Hertfordshire, stumped up a massive £600 for their flights home this morning after driving 90 miles from Milan to Turin to catch it. Their flight from Milan was cancelled after the resort they were staying in shut down over the weekend. Sam, 52, told MailOnline: 'We arrived at the resort in the Three Valleys, Champoluc, in Val d’Aosta, on Saturday. Sunday, our first day on the slopes was fantastic. 'But on Monday morning we found that everything had been shut down. 'The ski-lifts were closed, all the restaurants and bars were closed and most of the shops. Fortunately we found a little deli that was open and we bought some bread, eggs and pasta. ‘We changed our EasyJet flight from Milan to come back the next day. But it got cancelled overnight. I thought we would be stranded in Italy with no way to get home. 'So we stayed up all night looking for flights and managed to get this Ryanair flight from Turin. We left the resort at 4am managed to get one of the last flights out of Italy.' Meanwhile, travellers arriving from Italy say they have received conflicting advice about how to act on their return. Passengers arriving on Ryanair flights from Turin and Venice have told how misleading information is still on display at London’s Stansted Airport stating only visitors to Italy’s 'red zone' in the north must self-isolate. But the latest advice from Public Health England is that travellers from all of Italy must stay at home for 14 days whether or not they have any symptoms. Retired couple Michael and Wendy Bull from Harlow, Essex, must now self-isolate for 14 days after spending a weekend break in the Italian Alps near Turin. Mr Bull, 67, told MailOnline: 'Ryanair staff told us that we must self-isolate for 14 days after arriving from Italy. 'But the notice board in the arrivals hall says you only need to self-isolate if you have been in the red zone – Lombardy and other regions that have been worst affected. 'We know we must self-isolate for 14 days but that not what the notice boards are saying. 'We normally look after our grandchildren and we have a wedding and a funeral to go to, but we want to do the right thing and stay at home. 'Our daughter-in-law has already got us some shopping in so we should be ok.' Finance worker Ricardo Traini told how he would book an apartment to spare his flat-mates from possible exposure to the virus, after returning from Italy. Mr Traini, 34, from east London, told MailOnline: ‘I went to the Turin area to visit my relatives. But now I understand I must stay away from everyone for 14 days. ‘I am trying to book and AirBnB because I share a flat and I don’t want to infect my flat-mates.’ Self-employed worker Josh Wardle told how he will lose hundreds of pounds from self-isolating after visiting his girlfriend in Turin. The 24-year-old from Derbyshire, told MailOnline: 'I am a stair-lift engineer and if I don’t work I don’t get paid. But I’m going to follow the advice and self-isolate for two weeks. 'When I went to Italy a week ago this was not an issue. Turin was not in the red zone. Now it’s like a war zone. 'But I didn’t got out. We stayed at her apartment and got some shopping delivered. I had not seen my girlfriend for months so I was determined to go.' People in Italy are facing increasingly difficult trips home to the UK after British Airways and Jet2 yesterday announced they were cancelling all flights between the two countries. Ryanair will continue to fly as normal until Saturday - with customers in Italy able to fly home before it stopsall international flights from the virus-hit nation until April 8. EasyJet has cancelled all of its flights between Italy and the UK. Italian airline Alitalia has stopped flying out of Milan Malpensa and limited flights from Milan Linate to only domestic routes, but it continues to fly internationally out of Rome. Budget Spanish airlineVuelling is also running some flights. A couple flying intoLondon from Venice last night claimed they were given forms to fill out in case health officials had to track them down if a passenger was diagnosed – but nobody collected the forms. And a family who returned from northern Italy in half-term were reportedly told they did not need to self-isolate but, when one of them fell ill, only two were quarantined in a hospital to wait for test results which were eventually negative. The daughter was allowed to go to school. Thousands of Brits returning from Italy have said they are confused and frustrated by the Government's travel advice, with some passengers admitting they had no idea they were supposed to self-isolate at home for two weeks. People have also been surprised to find they are still able to travel as normal, facing no health checks or questioning at the British border, despite the impending threat of a major coronavirus outbreak in the UK. Italy is now the worst-hit country outside of China – more than 10,000 people there have caught the illness and at least 631 have died. The UK has now recorded more than 450 cases and six patients have died. The UK could be heading straight for a coronaviruscrisis like the one which has crippled Italy, leading experts have warned. Italy last night put all of its 60million people into lockdown and banned movement between cities in a drastic bid to contain the outbreak, which has infected 9,000 people. But one scientist tracking the outbreak in the UK said Britain is following the same trajectory and could end up in a similar situation as Italy within two weeks. The number of cases in Italy has rocketed from just three on February 21 to at least 9,172. While in the UK it has jumped from nine to 321. Denise Owens, who returned from Venice last night after a holiday with her husband, said there had been signs of precautions being taken but they were not followed through. She told MailOnline: 'While on the plane we all had to fill out forms so they could trace all passengers if one became ill. 'I went to hand mine in on the plane but was told we had to hand them in inside the airport, but there was no-one to give these forms to. Nobody was interested. Mine is still in my bag.' Another family who visited the north of Italy during February half-term said they were told they didn't need to self-isolate when they came home. Silvia Monchelato and her family, who have lived in London for 15 years, returned in the same week that Italy's rampant outbreak started to spiral out of control. They were told by NHS 111 that they did not need to isolate, she told MailOnline, but she and her son were taken into quarantine when he started to feel ill – but her daughter was sent back to school. Mrs Monchelato, who is Italian but has had both her children in the UK, had been to Veneto, one of the northern Italian regions at the heart of the country's outbreak and returned on February 26. She called an ambulance when her son started to have trouble breathing. She said: 'When [paramedics] arrived they told me to get off with my son and my daughter headed off to school. 'They took us to St Mary's Hospital and kept us inside the vehicle for about two hours until a team came to test us for the coronavirus. 'After this, with security, masked medical staff [came and] took us inside the hospital to a cubicle and locked us inside for four days until the negative test result arrived. 'What if the test had been positive? My daughter who travelled with us went to school all week, free to infect others. 'The measures that the British government is taking are not at all logical, consistent or protective.' People in Italy are facing increasingly difficult trips home to the UK after British Airways and Jet2 yesterday announced they were cancelling all flights between the two countries. Ryanair will continue to fly as normal until Saturday - with customers in Italy able to fly home before it stopsall international flights from the virus-hit nation until April 8. EasyJet has cancelled most of its flights at Milan, Venice and Verona but is still flying between other parts of Italy and the UK. The airline said anyone who has not been contacted can assume their flight is scheduled as normal. The budget airline also flies to England from airports in Bologna, Turin, Livorno, Ancona, Rome, Naples, Bari, Brindisi, Sicily and Sardinia. These services are not affected by cancellations, according to the firm's website. Vuelling is also running some flights. Italian airline Alitalia has stopped flying out of Milan Malpensa and limited flights from Milan Linate to only domestic routes, but it continues to fly internationally out of Rome. The UK's outbreak started in earnest last week when the number of confirmed patients more than doubled from 23 to 51 between Saturday, February 29, and Tuesday, March 3. Government officials have decided not to move to the second stage of Prime Minster Boris Johnson's coronavirus action plan, and remain in the first phase which focuses on trying to contain and stop the virus. NHS England has ramped up itscoronavirus testing capacity so10,000 swabs can be done every day as it braces for an explosion of cases. The health service is currently conducting around 1,500 daily tests. By comparison, South Korea has been able to swab up to 15,000 patients every day for the virus despite having a population of 50million compared to Britain's 66million. Currently there are around 100 testing centres in England and every sample has to be sent to one of 12 Public Health England laboratories. It means patients must wait around 48 hours for test results to come back. But now local NHS hospital labs are being equipped with test kits so they can conduct them on-site without having to send samples away. Most of the people testedshould get a result back within 24 hours, according to PHE. They have, however, admitted that they expect a 'significant' outbreak to take hold in Britain. England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, predicted 'many thousands of people' would get COVID-19. Most people only get a mild illness and don't need medical help, while others may be hospitalised and a small proportion will get pneumonia and die. Dr Harries told Sky News: 'We currently have relatively few cases here, which is why we are still in the containment phase [the first step of government action plan]. 'Obviously we will have significant numbers in a way in which the country is not used to. 'This is the sort of thing that professionally we're trained for and very rarely see, almost in a professional lifetime. 'Large numbers of the population will become infected because it's a naive population, nobody has got antibodies to this virus currently. 'We will see many thousands of people infected by coronavirus, that's what we're seeing in other countries and the important thing for us is to make sure that we manage those infections.' Engineer Anna De Luca, 30, who lives in Brighton and arrived at Gatwick yesterday, said: 'There were no checks at all.So I said, I will take some responsibility and wear the mask - even if it’s useless. 'But even in Naples they did a check, and told us to stay one metre away from the next person. And then on the plane there was nothing. We weren’t given any information. 'I just asked a man working here, he said maybe you should phone 111, but there were no checks at all.' Ryanair, British Airways and Jet2 have today cancelled hundreds of flights to and from Italy until April at the earliest and easyJet has also grounded most of its services leaving thousands of customers stranded in the coronavirus-hit country. BA has axed its 60 flights a day to cities including Milan, Venice and Rome while Jet2 has gone even further and cancelled all its Italian trips for almost six weeks until April 26. Ryanair today announced it had cancelled all flights from March 14 until April 9, but has told thousands of Brits trapped in Italy they can switch their return flight to come home before Saturday. EasyJet has stopped the majority of its flights to northern Italy but planes will still fly from southern cities such as Rome and Naples despite a blanket travel ban imposed by the Italian government as deaths reached almost 100 per day yesterday. Carmine Loru, 39, who arrived at Gatwick on a flight from Florence, said that he had been given no information about self-isolation. Mr Loru, whose family live in Florence, said: 'There is a lot of paranoia in Italy, but here there is not even anybody checking us. 'I read on the BBC that I’m supposed to stay at home for 14 days, but nobody said anything about that on the plane. In Florence they didn’t tell us anything about what to do in London.' Retired greengrocer Martin Rudd claimed the public hand-sanitiser pumps at Stansted Airport were empty and there was no up to date health advice when in the arrivals hall when he arrived from Pisa yesterday. The 64-year-old said: 'I'm in a high-risk group – I'm diabetic and I've had a triple heart by-pass – so I'm taking precautions. 'The hand-sanitiser pumps are empty and the only information is on a notice board in the arrivals hall. There isn't any one checking to see if people are unwell or taking anyone's temperature.' Mr Rudd, who had been on holiday in northern part of Italy but outside the original 'Red Zone' with his partner Linda Collis, booked an earlier flight after the Italian government announced a nationwide lock-down. He said: 'My son called warned us last night that travel restrictions were changing so I booked an earlier flight so we've come home this morning. In fact the plane was practically empty. There were on about 15 people on the flight.' Mr Rudd said he was taking a taxi home and would stay indoors for the required 14 days in accordance with the latest advice from Public Health England. He said: 'I've got grandchildren so I don't want to infect them. I'm well prepared. I've got lots of food in, everything I need. 'I bought a load of hand sanitizer before we left, in fact I took six bottles with us to Italy and I've been cleaning my hands after touching anything.'",0
5,"The World Health Organization today finally declared the coronavirusoutbreak a pandemic after blaming 'alarming levels of inaction' by governments across the planet for fueling the crisis. As the number of confirmed cases of the bug worldwide surpassed 112,000 - and the death toll neared 4,500 - the WHO said it was 'deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity'. Director-General of the UN agency Dr TedrosAdhanom also blasted governments for ignoring repeated WHO pleas to take urgent and aggressive action, with cases of the deadly illness outside of China having risen 13-fold in the space of a fortnight because of escalating crises in Italy, Iran, Spain, Germany, and France. The WHO said: 'Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.' In a desperate call for governments to band together and tackle the coronavirus, DrAdhanom said: 'We're in this together, to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It's doable.' The last pandemic - defined as the uncontrolled worldwide spread of a new disease - to be officially declared was the swine flu outbreak in 2009, which scientists estimate killed hundreds of thousands of people. More than 112,000 people globally have already been infected with the coronavirus, which can cause pneumonia but causes mild flu-like symptoms for 98 per cent of patients. Cases have slowed dramatically in China, where the bug first emerged at the end of December. However, the crisis has now enveloped Europe, where the number of cases rises by the day. Around 60million Italians - whose country is the worst-hid by the infection after China - are now subject to an official curfew imposed upon them by the Italian Government. Outbreaks are also worsening in Spain, France, Germany, and the UK; in the latter, the eighth confirmed death by the coronavirus was announced earlier, leading to charges of dithering by Boris Johnson's administration. Leading experts, including Germany's health minister, have called the crisis a pandemic for weeks – and the WHO itself has admitted the killer virus has been spreading between humans in four continents since February 28. An epidemic is a situation in which a disease takes hold in a single community, which could be a town, region or country. For an epidemic to be declared, the disease must be continuing to spread among the population without people having to catch it from other people and not from the disease's original source – in the case of the coronavirus this would be the animal market in Wuhan. A pandemic is when this ongoing person-to-person spread of the disease happens in multiple countries around the world. A disease being a pandemic does not make it more dangerous, nor change anything about how it affects people or what can be done to stop it. The World Health Organization had hesitated to declare a pandemic because, for a long time, most of the cases being seen in countries outside of China were in people who had travelled there or caught it directly from someone who travelled there. Now the disease is so widespread that people can catch it without any obvious link to China, and the numbers are continuing to rise worldwide despite travel bans, showing the virus is in constant circulation within various countries. A report by the WHO on Monday confirmed that the virus was spreading unchecked in at least 30 countries in Europe, which is now at the centre of the global crisis. In other developments to the escalating global crisis today: The specific definition of a pandemic are not universally agreed upon, but there are known to be three main criteria. These are: sustained person-to-person transmission, evidence of world-wide spread and a disease that can cause sudden illness or death. COVID-19 is a mild flu-like illness for the overwhelming majority of patients, which may explain why the WHO was so reluctant to call it a pandemic. Until today, it said the clusters of cases in other countries around the world could be traced back to Asia, where the situation began. Calling the outbreak a pandemic does not mean any advice given to countries on on how to contain the killer virus will change – it is just an admission that it is now spreading in dozens of nations. More countries have now confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the killer infection, than those that haven't. World Health Organization director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, applauded the efforts Italy, South Korea and Iran have been making to try and stop the coronavirus. Here's what they're doing: Italy Italy'sgovernment has this week put the entire country into a lockdown. Citizens have been told not to travel out of their hometowns unless it is necessary, and face jail time if they try to break the rules. They are allowed out to go shopping and to go to work in some cases. Schools, museums, sports events and large gatherings have all been closed or cancelled to stop people coming together in crowds. The country is urging all tourists who are there to leave and return to their home countries. South Korea South Korea has been hailed as a success in its coronavirus response as it appears to have managed to stem a rapidly spiralling outbreak. Thousands of people were infected there in a short space of time but the country locked down the worst-hit cities – Daegu and Cheongdo – and ramped up testing and isolation protocols. The nation quickly upgraded its response to a high alert level and was meticulous in tracing the contacts of its confirmed cases and testing and isolating them, too. Rapid diagnostic tests have been available there since mid-January, Pharmaceutical Technologyreports. It issued stay-home notices to citizens in Cheongdo and Daegu and sent the cities into shutdown while officials tracked down coronavirus patients. Iran Iran has also seen a devastating surge in coronavirus cases in a short time but has told its citizens to stop travelling around the country. The country's national airline has stopped all flights to Europe and the authorities have closed all schools and universities, stopped large events and sports matches, and cut people's working hours to try and reduce travel and slow down the spread of the virus. There are roadblocks with checks on people travelling around the city of Qom, where the outbreak started, The Guardian reported. At a press conference in Geneva – where the WHO is based, Dr Tedros revealed 81 countries have not reported any cases. He said: 'We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic.Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this coronavirus.' Dr Tedros said several countries have demonstrated the virus can be suppressed and controlled – outbreaks in China and South Korea have dramatically slowed. But he added the 'challenge for many countries' now dealing with large clusters 'is not whether they can do the same – it's whether they will'. Dr Tedros also said: 'Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources.' And in a veiled jab at some countries battling escalating outbreaks, he added: 'Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve.' He said: 'We are grateful for the measures being taken in Iran, Italy and South Korea to slow the virus and control their COVID19 epidemics. We know that these measures are taking a heavy toll on societies and economies, just as they did in China. 'All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic & social disruption & respecting human rights. 'This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector – so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight. 'I remind all countries that we are calling on you to: activate & scale up your emergency response mechanisms; communicate with your people about the risks and how they can protect themselves; find, isolate, test and treat every COVID19 case and trace every contact.'

A disease being a pandemic does not make it more dangerous, nor change anything about how it affects people or what can be done to stop it. A report by the WHO on Monday confirmed that the virus was spreading unchecked in 30 countries in Europe, which is now at the centre of the global crisis. The list of countries include Spain, Germany and France – popular Easter holiday destinations for thousands of Brits looking to jet abroad. It comes after an elderly woman today became the first person to die of the killer coronavirus in the Republic of Ireland. The patient, who hasn't been identified, suffered from respiratory symptoms before a doctor decided to test for COVID-19. Health chiefs in Ireland did not reveal her age but said she died earlier today despite treatment at a hospital in the east of the country. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: 'I would like to extend my condolences to the family and friends of this patient.' Iran today reported 63 new deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day toll since it announced the first deaths from the outbreak. In an attempt to combat the disease, firefighters were deployed this morning to spray disinfectant over the city's streets. Iran's Health Ministry said the deaths are among some 9,000 confirmed cases in Iran, where the virus has spread to all of the country's provinces. Iran is yet to officially impose quarantines but authorities have repeatedly called on people to refrain from travelling. It hasclosed schools and universities and resorted to shutting hotels and other tourist accommodation to discourage travel. Among the dead are five of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard members and an unspecified number of the Guard's volunteer Basij force. There are concerns that the number of infections across Iran is much higher than the confirmed cases reported by the government, which is struggling to contain or manage its spread. The rising casualty figures each day in Iran suggest the fight against the new coronavirus is far from over. In other developments, a British woman died of coronavirus in Indonesia – becoming the country's first death in the epidemic. Indonesia's government said the 53-year-old woman with diabetes and lung disease had died in hospital after being admitted in a critical condition. Reports in Indonesia say she was cremated today. Her husband was also in Indonesia and is due to return to Britain soon, officials say. It means eight Brits have now died from COVID-19. The first death to be recorded was a holidaymaker onboard the doomed Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined off the coast of Japan. Six fatalities have since been recorded in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to record any deaths.

Iran is yet to officially impose quarantines but authorities have repeatedly called on people to refrain from travelling. It has closed schools and universities and resorted to shutting hotels and other tourist accommodation to discourage travel. Italy has the highest coronavirus death rate in the world with one in every 16 people who catch the disease there dying from it. At least 10,149 people have now been diagnosed with the virus, making it the worst hit country outside of China, and 631 are confirmed to have died. Its death rate is 6.22 per cent, according to the most recent data – the highest in the world. The deadly impact in Italy has been put down to three possible factors – a huge population of old people, cases being concentrated in a small area, and a lag in testing meaning the number of total cases is inaccurate. Italy has the biggest population of elderly people in Europe, with almost a quarter of people (22 per cent) aged 65 or older. And the median age – the middle of the age range – is 46.5 years old, according to the CIA – the fifth highest in the world. For comparison, the UK's median age is 40.6 (18 per cent aged over 65) and the US's is 38.5 (17 per cent over 65). The older someone is, the more deadly catching the coronavirus can be. Age is known to be one of the biggest risk factors because the immune system and lungs are naturally weaker so the body is less able to fend off pneumonia, which the virus causes in severe cases. Research has found that people aged 80 or over have a 14.8 per cent risk (one in seven) of dying if they develop COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Among the dead are five of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard members and an unspecified number of the Guard's volunteer Basij force. There are concerns that the number of infections across Iran is much higher than the confirmed cases reported by the government, which is struggling to contain or manage its spread. The rising casualty figures each day in Iran suggest the fight against the new coronavirus is far from over. It comes after a passenger was arrested for licking his hand and wiping it on a handrail on the Belgian subway, forcing the train to be taken off service and disinfected. The unidentified man, who appears intoxicated, can be seen removing his mask before bringing his hand to his mouth and licking it. He then brings his right hand up to the vertical rail and grips it, before rubbing it along the bar. The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company, the capital's public transport provider, tweeted shortly after the event: 'The man (intoxicated) was arrested by the police and our security service. 'The subway train was withdrawn from service to be disinfected. Thank you for your message. Our metros are cleaned every day.' The video, posted by a user who preferred to remain anonymous, was uploaded to Twitter on Saturday and social media users were outraged by the man's behaviour. Elsewhere in Europe, Poland today closed all schools, museums and cinemas, while Ukraine's capital city Kiev will shut all educational buildings due to fears of coronavirus spreading despite both countries having lower rates of infection compared to the rest of Europe. Speaking at a joint conference following a special meeting on coronavirus, Polish ministers said that pre-schools and schools would stop teaching on Thursday, but limited care would still be provided this week to the youngest children. Universities, museums, theaters and cinemas will also close on Thursday for two weeks, the officials said. The WHO drew flak for declaring the 2009 swine flu outbreak a pandemic, which turned out to be mild and less deadly than feared. It used to use a six-phase system for outbreaks, with phase six being a full-blown pandemic. Critics said the WHO created panic about swine flu and caused governments to stockpile vaccines which went unused. Some even questioned its links to the pharmaceutical industry, after firms such as GlaxoSmithKline profited from producing a H1N1 vaccine. H1N1, which emerged in Mexico and the US, is thought to have killed up to 200,000 people in more than 200 countries. WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told MailOnline that the body no longer uses the six-tier phasing system but added its advice 'remains the same'. He said: 'We continue working with countries to limit the spread of the virus while also preparing for the possibility of wider spread.' The WHO eventually declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30. The WHO rejected making the coronavirus outbreak a PHEIC before its eventual U-turn. It is only the sixth time the term has been used. The designation, still in place, was aimed at helping countries with weaker health systems shore up their defenses, especially in Africa.   The move is also being carried out by Poland's neighbour, Ukraine, in its capital city, Kiev. Poland has confirmed 26 cases of coronavirus, but looking at how fast the virus spreads in some other European countries, the government decided to take the preventive action, officials said. The Mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko, whose country has counted just one case, said he was introducing similar 'preventive measures'. The WHO earlier this month admitted the killer coronavirus outbreak sweeping the world won't be officially declared a pandemic. Instead, the UN-body said the crisis has already been a public health emergency of international concern – the highest warning level – for a month.

At least 10,149 people have now been diagnosed with the virus, making it the worst hit country outside of China, and 631 are confirmed to have died. Its death rate is 6.22 per cent, according to the most recent data – the highest in the world. In China the death rate is 3.91 per cent and scientists have suggested if that is higher than the true figure because many cases are likely to be going unreported. The deadly impact in Italy has been put down to three possible factors – a huge population of old people, cases being concentrated in a small area, and a lag in testing meaning the number of total cases is inaccurate. Only Wuhan and the Hubei province around it have more cases of the coronavirus than Lombardy, the worst hit area in Italy, which is putting immense pressure on local health systems. Italy has become the unlikely epicenter of the world's coronavirus crisis. It yesterday recorded a massive 168 deaths in a single day and, on Monday, had at least 1,492 new infections confirmed. Even in the peak of its own epidemic, China – with a population 22 times the size of Italy's – never recorded more than 3,900 in a day. Government complacency has been blamed for the speed at which the outbreak has gripped the country, but the age of its citizens may be what is causing the deaths. Italy has the biggest population of elderly people in Europe, with almost a quarter of people (22 per cent) aged 65 or older. And the median age – the middle of the age range – is 46.5 years old, according to the CIA – the fifth highest in the world. For comparison, the UK's median age is 40.6 (18 per cent aged over 65) and the US's is 38.5 (17 per cent over 65). The older someone is, the more deadly catching the coronavirus can be. Age is known to be one of the biggest risk factors because the immune system and lungs are naturally weaker so the body is less able to fend off pneumonia, which the virus causes in severe cases. Research has found that people aged 80 or over have a 14.8 per cent risk (one in seven) of dying if they develop COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The local president of Lombardy,Attilio Fontana, confirmed: 'All the deaths we've had are either very old people or very sick people,' the New York Times reported. THE SICK MUST STAY AT HOME People who have tested positive for coronavirus must not leave their homes for any reason. Anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms is urged to stay at home and limit social contact, including with their doctor. NO TRAVEL ACROSS ITALY Travel is only allowed for 'urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons'. Grocery shopping is considered a 'necessity' and still allowed. To avoid work-related travel, public and private companies have been urged to put their staff on leave. Flights, trains and public transport will continue but Prime Minister GiuseppeConte says he wants as many people as possible to stay at home. People who do want to travel will need to fill in a document explaining their reasons for doing so and carry it with them. NO PUBLIC GATHERINGS 'All forms of gatherings in public places or sites open to the public' are banned, the decree says. Cinemas, museums, theatres, pubs, dance schools, betting shops and discos are all closed. Weddings and funerals are banned. Schools and universities will remain shut until April 3. Bars and restaurants were only allowed to open between 8am and 6pm, the decree said, and only if a distance of at least 3ft could be kept between customers. Sporting events of all levels and disciplines were cancelled - stopping play in the Serie A football league.Fixtures in international competitions can go ahead but will be played behind closed doors. Gyms, sports centres, swimming pools, spas and leisure centres must close. SHOPS MUST KEEP 3FT DISTANCE Shops can remain open but only if they can guarantee the 3ft safety distance for customers. Big and mid-sized shopping centres have to close at the weekend. Food stores are allowed to remain open at all hours. NO LEAVE FOR HEALTH WORKERS Leave for health workers is cancelled. People accompanying their friends or relatives to emergency units are not allowed to stay with them in the waiting rooms without express permission. ALL OF ITALY IS COVERED The entire country, including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, is covered by the decree - covering a total population of some 60million people. As patient ages decline, so do their chances of dying. Between 60 and 69 years old the death rate is around 3.6 per cent, while it is more like 1.3 per cent for those aged 50 to 59. For people in their 40s this drops to 0.4 per cent, and it's just 0.2 per cent for those in their 30s. People who have other long-term health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease or cancer are also at a greater risk because they have weaker immune systems than usual. Italians caught up in the country's coronavirus outbreak may also be at particularly high risk because most of the cases are concentrated in a small area. The northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto are the ones that have been hardest hit by the infection. Lombardy is an area smaller than England with Milan as its only major city, but is host to more than 5,000 coronavirus cases, while the surrounding regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont contain the majority of the remainder. This means Lombardy has more cases than any province of China outside of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital. That region alone has more cases than Spain, France, Germany or the US do in total. As a result local hospitals are under immense pressure, which means patients may not get the high quality care they need and the virus could be more likely to spread in overloaded hospitals. Experts also say that the true number of cases is not being recorded in Italy because the infection is spreading so fast and people with mild illness may not be counted. This means the death rate appears higher than it is because all the deaths will be counted – most patients will have been hospitalised and diagnosed before dying –but not all the infections. Krys Johnson, a disease expert at Temple University in Philadelphia, admitted: 'We probably don't know how many people have actually become infected,' according to Scientific American. The situation is so bad in Italy partly because the Government stopped testing people in late January unless they had been to China. Strict rules had been put in place to test anyone with the symptoms of coronavirus but, after the Government banned all flights from China – it was the first country to do so – the testing relaxed. As a result, infected people are believed to have travelled into Italy from other countries. The first confirmed patient is thought to have passed the virus on to at least five other people, including doctors and patients in the hospital he was taken to, before even being diagnosed. Officials still don't know how the man, a 38-year-old in Milan, was infected, and there are fears the virus circulated for weeks before he was discovered. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 4,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 110,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 – possibly 9,700 – were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 – doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests – caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. There is now evidence that it can spread third hand – to someone from a person who caught it from another person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak is an epidemic, which is when a disease takes hold of one community such as a country or region. Although it has spread to dozens of countries, the outbreak is not yet classed as a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. The head of WHO's global infectious hazard preparedness, Dr Sylvie Briand, said: 'Currently we are not in a pandemic. We are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci, and we try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci,' the Guardian reported. She said that most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.",0
6,"New York City has canceled its St Patrick's Day parade for the first time in more than 250 years as the coronavirus continues to spread across the Big Apple. The parade was scheduled to take place on Tuesday, March 17. New York's parade is the most important St Patrick's Day parade in the US and typically attracts two million spectators. Scroll down for video The New York parade, which goes up Fifth Avenue from 44th Street to 80th, has taken place every year since 1762. The event takes on a crowded party atmosphere, and attendees are known to consume large amounts of beer and other alcoholic beverages - which could make following precautionary social distancing measures intended to stem the spread of the virus more difficult. Mayor Bill de Blasio has yet to confirm the cancellation, but City Councilwoman Carlina Rivera told the New York Post that the parade will not proceed. De Blasio said earlier on Wednesday that he was considering canceling the parade. 'We're talking it through with the parade committee.We have to really think about this one because it's a beloved event, an important event,' he said. There have been at least 20 confirmed coronavirus cases in New York and the city has yet to enact any official isolation measures, though Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency. On Wednesday,Cuomo said that health experts are recommending that New York City’s venerable St Patrick’s Day parade be cancelled amid the coronavirus outbreak. 'Why would you risk bringing thousands of people together knowing that this is virus that easily communicates?' Cuomo asked, explaining the thinking of those urging the event be canceled. The governor told a news conference at the state Capitol that officials would likely make a decision later Wednesday, but Cuomo has not confirmed the cancellation either. Earlier on Wednesday, Chicago's mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the cancellation of the city's St Patrick's Day parade amid coronavirus concerns. According to the parade's website, the river dyeing has also been canceled for Saturday.No other details were released. Chicago doesn't have any confirmed corornavirus cases, but the state of Illinois has 19. The mayor's announcement came just a day after Boston canceled their St Patrick's Day parade. The Boston parade, originally scheduled for March 15, was expected to attract about one million attendees. The decision to cancel the parade was made 'out of an abundance of caution to ensure that we are doing what is needed to keep the residents of Boston safe and healthy,' mayor Marty Walsh said in a statement shared via Twitter. 'While the risk in Boston remains low, this situation is changing very quickly,' the statement said. 'Our top priority is preventing any new cases, to the best of our ability.' March celebrations honoring Saint Patrick, the patron of Ireland, bring together more people in the US - where millions of people are descended from Irish immigrants - than in Ireland itself, where the government on Monday also canceled festivities. Social, political and business events have been canceled around the world in an effort to slow the deadly coronavirus's transmission. There have been more than 121,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the world and more than 4,300 deaths. In the US, there are more than 1,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 32 deaths.",0
7,"Dr. Anthony Fauci warned on Wednesday the coronavirus situation in the United States is going to get worse and 'many, many millions' will be affected. His warning came as 33 people in the United States have died, the number of infected topped 1,000, the stock markets tanked and several schools said they would move to online classes after spring break out of fears of infection. 'Bottom line, it's going to get worse,' Fauci, the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at congressional hearing on the outbreak. He warned millions will be affected. 'If we are complacent and don’t do really aggressive containment and mitigation, the number could go way up and be involved in many, manymillions. If we contain we could flatten it,' he noted. He also recommended large sporting events be banned. 'We would recommend that there not be large crowds. If that means not having any people in the audience as the N.B.A. plays, so be it,' he said. And he warned that the mortality rate for coronavirus is at least 10 times that of regular seasonal flu - to which it has been compared by President Donald Trump. He said that the WHO estimated it to be lethal in 3.4% of recorded cases so far, a figure he expects to drop to 1% - 'which means it’s 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.' Fauci, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DirectorRobert Redfield, and other administration officials sat before the House Oversight committee to testify on the administration's response to the epidemic. The hearing quickly turned into a bipartisan bickering match with Democrats criticizing the administration's response and Republicans accusing the other side of playing politics. At the top of the hearing, Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney announced their testimony would be cut short because President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence called an 'emergency meeting' at the White House later today on the coronavirus. She did not offer more details. When she ended the meeting at 11:35 a.m., the New York Democrat said: 'I don’t know what is going on White House.' She noted that the White House is telling journalists the meeting was scheduled yesterday. However, she added: ‘Your staff said the White House did not tell them about this sudden meeting until this morning. There seems to be a great deal of confusion and lack of coordination at the White House.’ And two members of the committee - incoming White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Rep. Paul Gosar - were not present because they are self-quarantining after coming into contact with the person at CPAC who tested positive for coronavirus. Fauci offered his grim prognosis under questioning from Democratic lawmakers, who were critical over the lacking of testing kits available for the disease. 'My constituents are telling me they can't get tested,' Maloney told the witnesses.'South Korea can test more people in one day than we have tested in the past two months.' South Korea has said it's testing 10,000 people a day. 'Unfortunately when we look at the last three months objectively it is clear that strategic errors and a failure of leadership impaired our nation's ability to respond to this outbreak. This in turn endangers us all,' she said. She asked Fauci: 'Is the worst yet to come?' 'Yes it is,' he responded. He cited concerns about 'community spread' in his response. And he noted that how much worse it gets depends on two things: the ability of U.S. authorities to curtail the influx of travelers who may be bringing the disease into the country and the ability of states and communities to contain local outbreaks in this country. He also noted the United States is 'going to have to rely on public health measures to contain this outbreak.' And Redfield argued the CDC has put out 75,000 tests. He noted any health center can send a sample to the agency's headquarters in Atlanta for testing and get the results in a couple of days. ‘It’s not just for an individual to take a test, they need to see a medical professional and have an assessment,' he said. He also revealed there was a problem with the first set of testing kits developed by the CDC which set back sending them out to health centers. He declined to provide details on what the problem was or what company had manufactured the problem kits. President Donald Trump has blamed federal regulations put in place by the Obama administration for the delay in testing. Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a close ally of President Trump on Capitol Hill, defended the administration's response and appealed for bipartisanship. 'On this issue we should all work together for the health of every American. We should not play politics with coronavirus,' he said. 'He should all come together under President Trump’s leadership.' The total number of US deaths now stands at 31, with most of them coming from a Washington care home. The number of confirmed infections has also hit 1,039 on Wednesday morning, after 274 new cases were recorded across the country on Tuesday. However experts believe that is likely an under-estimate and the true number could be in excess of 10,000. The new deaths were confirmed as: Since the pandemic began last month, there have been at least 1,025 confirmed cases in more than 35 states, according to The New York Times. However, researchers fromCedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Peking University in Beijing have published research suggesting that there could be as many as 9,000 additional cases that have gone undetected. The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services has admitted that not everyone can be tested for coronavirus if they suspect they are infected. Alex Azar revealed that there's a surplus of testing kits, with 1.1 million already at labs across the country, and a million more on the way, during a coronavirus task force briefing in Washington DC on Tuesday. Despite 4 million more tests due to be delivered by the end of the week, Alex Azar said Americans will only be able to find out whether they have contracted COVID-19 if a doctor gives the go-ahead. 'There's a false premise. Just because I as a person say I'd like to be tested for coronavirus, I can walk into a Minute Clinic and say 'give me my test please' – that's not how diagnostic testing works in the United States or frankly anywhere else', Azar said.

They believe a small group of around a dozen people likely passed undetected into the US in the early stages of the outbreak, before spreading it in their local communities. Using the latest data available on the virus and plugging it into a computer to model how it might have spread, they believe that as of March 1 there could be as many as ten times the number of cases as has been reported. That number will only have gone up since then, they warned. The research has yet to be peer-reviewed, meaning it is still in its early stages and the conclusion may change. Using disease modeling software to anticipate how the virus might have spread, they As of late Tuesday, at least 31 people have died - 24 in Washington State, three in California, two in Florida, and one death each in New Jersey and South Dakota. More than 119,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and over 4,200 have died in dozens of countries. At least 10 long-term care facilities in the Seattle area have reported COVID-19 cases, with deaths at three of them - a worrying development as health officials have cautioned that the elderly and those with underlying conditions are especially at risk. Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Tuesday outlined a list of requirements for such centers aimed at stopping the worst coronavirus outbreak in the nation. A nursing home in Issaquah and another in Seattle each reported the death of a resident, bringing the total COVID-19 deaths in the state to at least 24. King County reported new cases were found in 10 long-term facilities where residents or staff or both have tested positive. The county reported an increase of 74 positive cases since Monday bringing the total to 190. Snohomish County said it had 54 confirmed cases. That brought the statewide total to more than 250, and Inslee said that number is likely much higher. At a news conference Inslee also said the state is preparing for many more cases than have been reported, potentially tens of thousands, based on estimates of the spread of the disease. 'If we assume there are 1,000 or more people who have the virus today....the number of people who are infected will double in five to eight days,' Inslee said. 'If you do the math, it gets very disturbing.' The state has experienced the worst outbreak of COVID-19 in the nation. Schools, houses of worship and large gathering places in the New York suburb that has the 'largest cluster' of coronavirus cases in the country will be shut down as the National Guard is being brought in to help stop the spread of the disease. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that a one-mile containment area will be set up in New Rochelle in Westchester County where the main cluster of coronavirus have been reported. The area is the epicenter of of the state's coronavirus outbreak and accounts for more than 100 of New York's 173 confirmed cases. The radius centers around theTemple Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue that was attended by the Manhattan attorney who has been linked to the outbreak in the area. The shutdown, which will begin on Thursday and last for two weeks, will effect all 'major gathering places' including schools and places of worship, Cuomo said. 'It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. And this is literally a matter of life and death,' Cuomo said. The announcement about the containment area came as New Jersey reported its first coronavirus death. It is the first fatality in the tri-state area. Westchester (including New Rochelle): 108 New York City: 36 Nassau: 19 Rockland: 6 Saratoga: 2 Suffolk: 1 Ulster: 1 Cuomo said he was calling in the National Guard to the containment area to assist with cleaning public spaces and to deliver food to homes where people are currently self-quarantined. Health officials said they are still trying to determine a full list of places that will be forced to close within the containment area. The schools that will close includeNew Rochelle High School,Albert Leonard Middle School andWilliam B. Ward Elementary. The closures will not effect smaller businesses and grocery stores, officials said. Cuomo said people will not be contained and residents are free to come and go with the one-mile radius. The state and a private health system,Northwell Health, are also setting up a testing facility in the area. New Rochelle is at the center of an outbreak of 108 cases in Westchester County, out of 173 statewide as of Tuesday. New York City has 36 cases, while its population is more than 100 times that of New Rochelle. 'New Rochelle at this point is probably the largest cluster in the U.S. of these cases and it is a significant issue for us,' Cuomo said. 'The numbers have been going up. The numbers continue to go up. The numbers are going up unabated. And we do need a special public health strategy for New Rochelle.' New York Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker said officials were moving from a containment strategy to a mitigation strategy. 'When you're dealing with mitigation, you have to deal with the issues of social distancing and how people gather together and to try to minimize that.' Cuomo said the decision was one made by Dr Zucker and other public health officials. 'It's not a decision that I'm making. I'm accepting the recommendation of Dr. Zucker. In a situation like this, whether you're president, mayor, governor, let the experts decide and let the science decide the situation,' he said. Alarming clusters of the coronavirus swelled on both coasts of the U.S. on Tuesday, with more than 70 cases now tied to a biotech conference in Boston and infections turning up at 10 nursing homes in the hard-hit Seattle area. Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden abruptly canceled rallies because of worries about the virus, and New York's governor announced he is sending the National Guard to scrub public places and deliver food in a New York City suburb that is at the center of the nation's biggest known cluster of infections. Top national disease expert Anthony Fauci is urging the nation to take an 'all hands on deck' approach to the coronavirus – and urging officials to plan for immediate measures even in states that haven't had cases show up yet. 'It doesn't matter if you're in a state that has no cases or one case,' Fauci said at a press briefing with Vice President Mike Pence Tuesday. 'You have to start taking seriously what you can do now that if and when the infections will come – and they will come – sorry to say, sad to say, they will,' he told reporters. 'Everybody should say all hands on deck, this is what we need to do,' said Fauci, a top expert on infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health who has served in the government for decades. Fauci said coronavirus cases continue to add up globally, and said the administration was paying 'paying particular attention to the cases in Europe, Italy and France.' Italy is currently in a nation-wide lockdown for the disease, which first emerged in China. 'This is not a surprise to anybody,' he said, and pointed to tips and warnings on the new coronavirus.gov website. Fauci wouldn't now be appropriate for such measures as immediately closing U.S. schools as a way to try to contain the outbreak, even as individual schools in areas with outbreaks were closed for deep cleaning. But he warned: 'Everything is on the table for consideration.' 'So the idea that we're not closing all – I mean i think for the country right now to say we're going to close all the schools in the country, I don't think would be appropriate. 'Would school closures be appropriate depending upon not whether you have already, the horse is out of the barn, but when you start to see we're getting danger here so let's do it?' On Wednesday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee will announce a ban on gatherings and events of more than 250 people in virtually the entire Seattle metro area to try to stop the spread of the outbreak, said a person involved in the planning of the decision. The ban would apply to sporting events like Seattle Mariners baseball and Seattle Sounders soccer games. The order would not prohibit the operation of workplaces and is not expected to include school closures, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Santa Clara County in California, home to San Jose and Silicon Valley, on Monday announced a ban on all gatherings of 1,000 people or more. Also in California, three Transportation Security Administration officers at Mineta San Jose International Airport have tested positive for COVID-19, the agency said Tuesday. They were receiving medical care and all TSA employees who had contact with them over the past 14 days are being quarantined at home, the agency said. And amid criticism of the US authorities' response, New York deployed the National Guard for the first time during the crisis to help contain the spread of the disease from an infection-hit suburb. There have been 173 confirmed cases in New York state, including 108 in Westchester County, home to New Rochelle where the majority of infections have been detected. 'It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. This is literally a matter of life and death,' said state governor Andrew Cuomo. 'People are scared, it's an unusual situation to be in,' Miles Goldberg, who runs a New Rochelle bar, told AFP. 'It makes people nervous to be around others, it makes people nervous to get inside into businesses and such,' he said. In the United States, organizers rescheduled the two-week Coachella music festival and its sister event, the Stagecoach festival, for October. The virus and the response to the crisis has prompted pandemonium on global markets with volatility not seen since the world financial crisis in 2008. After suffering its worst session in more than 11 years at the beginning of the week, the Dow Jones Index in New York bounced back significantly, rising five percent on Tuesday. President Donald Trump, who is relying on a strong economy to boost his re-election hopes, promised to announce 'major' economic measures on Tuesday. The biggest item on his wish list is a cut in payroll taxes. But even allies in Congress and reportedly some aides in the White House are skeptical, questioning the cost. The outbreak, which has already reshaped the professional sports landscape in Europe, prompted new restrictions to restrict fan access in the US on Tuesday, with major decisions looming about baseball's opening day and college basketball's NCAA Tournament. College games will be played without fans in Ohio and California, and given restrictions on large gatherings there and elsewhere, more disruptions to the sports calendar appear inevitable. The NCAA said it would 'make decisions in the coming days' about its men's and women's basketball tournaments after two conferences banned fans from their championships and another canceled its tournament altogether. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency as cases statewide jumped by 51 from the day before, to 92. Of that number, 70 are now connected to a meeting held last month by biotech company Biogen at a hotel in downtown Boston. Baker said the state of emergency will give him greater authority to take such actions as shutting down large events, gaining access to buildings or stockpiling protective gear. The moves came as the battle to stop the virus from spreading intensified. More schools and universities sent students home, while conferences and other events were canceled. The United Nations announced it would close its New York headquarters to the public and suspend all tours. The Coachella music festival that draws tens of thousands to the California desert near Palm Springs every April was postponed until October. And one of the biggest resort operators in Las Vegas, MGM Resorts International, said it would close buffets at all of its Las Vegas Strip casinos as a precaution. More than 1,400 passengers have been evacuated from the Grand Princess cruise ship harbored in Oakland amid fears they could have coronavirus after 21 people on board were diagnosed with the virus. Four hundred people were taken off the boat on Monday after passing through medical tents to check for virus symptoms, before another 999 were evacuated Tuesday. Of those taken off the boat, 240 Canadians and 140 Britons have been put on specially-chartered flights back home to start quarantine in their own countries. Meanwhile hundreds of Americans have been bussed off to military bases where they will stay for at least two weeks to wait out possible infections. That means 1,015 passengers and 1,113 crew remain on the ship, with more evacuations planned for Wednesday. Among those who disembarked Monday were two travelers who tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. They were taken to the hospital alongside their travel companions. Nineteen crew members also tested positive Friday but have been deemed 'asymptomatic' and remain on the ship in isolated cabins. Addressing a news conference on Tuesday in Sacramento, the state capital, Governor Gavin Newsom said he hoped to finish getting all the roughly 2,400 passengers off the ship within 72 hours. On Tuesday night, 142 Britons were flown back to the United Kingdom but will not be placed into quarantine. Instead, they will be asked to self-isolate at home and told to only get in touch with the NHS if they fall ill - despite the fact infect patients are highly contagious a week before showing symptoms. They are expected to land back in the UK on Wednesday morning A top federal health official pointed to Europe, rather than the virus' point of origin in China, as the likely source for the infection's continued spread to the U.S. 'Right now the epicenter — the new China — is Europe,' Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Capitol Hill. 'And there's a lot of people coming back and forth from Europe that are now starting to seed these communities.' Authorities in Washington state reported two new deaths from the virus — a man and woman, both in their 80s, who were residents of a nursing home and a senior center. Of the 24 deaths in the state, 19 have been tied to a single nursing home, Life Care Center of Kirkland. But the state officials said they are now working with 10 nursing facilities where residents or workers have been tested positive. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced new nursing-home rules that would limit visitors and subject health care workers to screening. Similarly, in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said state-run nursing homes will severely restrict visitors, with private operators strongly urged to follow suit. Six cases have been diagnosed in the state. The decisions by both Democratic presidential candidates to call off rallies in Cleveland came as voters headed to the polls for a primary election in neighboring Michigan. 'We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak,' Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said in a statement. 'All future Bernie 2020 events will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.' For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks, as has happened with three-quarters of those infected in China. On Wall Street, stocks surged Tuesday after suffering staggering losses the day before, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 1,100 points on hopes the Trump administration would take steps to cushion the economy from the damage caused by the outbreak. In Oakland, California, thousands of restless passengers who have been stuck aboard a cruise ship hit by the coronavirus waited their turn to get off the vessel and go to U.S. military bases or back to their home countries for two weeks of quarantine. 'I'm bored and frustrated,' said Carolyn Wright, 63, of Santa Fe, New Mexico. 'All of a sudden a two-week vacation has turned into a five-week vacation.' After being forced to idle for days off the California coast, the ship docked Monday in Oakland with about 3,500 passengers and crew, including at least 21 who tested positive for the virus. Authorities said foreign passengers would be flown home, while Americans would be flown or bused to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia. About 1,100 crew members, 19 of whom tested positive for the virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere after passengers are unloaded, Gov. Gavin Newsom said.",0
8,"This is the disturbing moment an 'acutely psychotic' daughter who killed her mother and cut off her head was caught on CCTV carrying it around. Paranoid schizophrenic Odessa Carey, 36, was too unwell to enter a plea to a murder charge but following a trial of the facts, a jury found she killed her mother. The headless body of her 73-year-old mother, also called Odessa, was found at the pensioner's home in Ashington, Northumberland, last April. Carey was arrested after police found her hiding in the loft of a different house in Guide Post. Her mother's head was found under a sink by a police officer. Police released two clips. In the first, daughter Carey was seen walking down the street with her mother's head in a shopping bag. In the second, the woman is found by police hiding in the loft. During the trial, Nicholas Lumley, prosecuting, said that the day before she was arrested, the daughter had visited the allotment of a friend of her late father and she had blood on her hands and arms when she turned up. The QC told Newcastle Crown Court: 'She had with her a bag, the contents of which she showed to the allotment holder. It was a human head. She kissed it. 'It can only have been her mother's head.' Mr Lumley said the allotment holder did not have a phone and did not contact police, but went to the pub and told someone what he had seen. Someone else he had told contacted police the next day, and the daughter was tracked down and arrested. After the jurors returned their findings, Judge Paul Sloan told them: 'The evidence which I heard before you were empanelled confirms that the defendant is acutely psychotic. 'It is likely that a diagnosis is one of schizophrenia. She suffers from paranoid delusional beliefs. 'She doesn't believe the body to be that of her mother. She is acutely unwell, so far all attempts to treat her have not been successful.' Judge Sloan said the defendant, who is being treated atRampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire, will be sentenced under the Mental Health Act tomorrow. The judge said: 'The finding that you have returned does not lead to punishment, that would not be appropriate. 'What is appropriate is measures are put in place to continue efforts to treat her and also have measures in place to ensure public protection.' It can now be reported that at a magistrates' court hearing, Carey answered the murder charge by saying: 'Not my mam, someone else.' At the end of that hearing, she asked the magistrate: 'Could it be investigated that my mam disappeared four years ago?' Outside court, her family said: 'Our mam will be sadly missed by all - her sons, daughter, her brothers and sisters, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews and friends. 'Sadly she was taken from us in a horrific and vicious attack by our younger sister, who had suffered mental health issues for many years. 'Our mam was a loving, caring woman who would help anyone that needed it.She also loved to talk to anybody she met. 'She was taken from us too soon and had a lot more to give. We believe that the mental health system failed us and vast improvements need to be made. 'It is too late for our mam and sister, but hopefully they will learn from our tragic loss and stop others from going through the same heartbreak. 'Our wounds will never heal, and we will miss our mam every single day.' It has emerged she received treatment from a young age for a variety of mental health issues and had stopped taking her medication in the weeks before the killing. Detective Chief Inspector Jane Fairlamb, of Northumbria Police's Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'This is a deeply distressing and disturbing case and I can't even the imagine the pain and suffering the Carey family continue to go through.'",0
9,"A couple had a drunken 'mile high club' romp aboard a holiday jet while in their seats as children watched on, a court heard today. Mother-of-three Gemma Heap, 35, and 38-year old Philip Mycock allegedly had intercourse whileon a flight from Manchester to Tunisia on July 29 last year. They were both subsequently charged with outraging public decency and being drunk on an aircraft. At Manchester Magistrates' Court today, Heap and Mycock, both from Whitefield Bury, faced a district judge. They asked for trial by crown court judge and jury and could face jail if convicted. The maximum sentencing for outraging public decency is seven years in jail whilst being drunk on aircraft carries up to two years imprisonment. Earlier Heap and Mycock spoke only to confirm names, dates of birth and addresses and that they understood the charges. They entered not guilty pleas to both counts and looked on impassively as they sat together in the dock. The brief hearing was told the alleged incident occurred on Thomas Cook flight MT 820 which was travelling to Enfeda Airport in Tunisia. The charge states that the pair in a 'public place committed an act outraging public decency by behaving in an indecent manner, namely had or appeared to have sexual intercourse in the presence of other passengers whilst sat in your seat on board the aircraft.' Prosecutor Nicola Durham said: 'It is alleged they had sex on their seats in front of children. 'The maximum sentence for being drunk on an aircraft is two years imprisonment and the legal guidance suggests sentencing for this matter would not be in excess of two years for either of these offences.' Heap and Mycock were granted unconditional bail pending a pre-trial hearing next month at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. Their lawyer Elizabeth Syddall told the district judge her clients denied wrongdoing and said: 'They weren't drunk sir.' Adjourning the case District Judge Mark Hadfield said: 'They have indicated they want to go to crown court. They will have to appear next month.' ",0
10,"A suicidal teenager is said to have threatened to expose a relationship between a care assistant and a girl patient a year before she killed herself, a court heard. Alisha Watts, 18, had been an in-patient at a Berkshire mental health unit when she is said to have learned of Eric Kusi's alleged sexual abuse of a 15-year-old patient. Kusi, 29, was suspended from the hospital after rumours of his suspected behaviour towards Alisha - who later committed suicide - began to circulate. He is accused of six counts of sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder by a carer. None of the charges brought forward relate to Alisha. A jury at Reading Crown Court heard today that the alleged victim, then 15, claimed she made the confession to Alisha, a star pupil at the prestigious Kendrick School. It is claimed that Alisha told the complainant: 'Ifyou do not report it to staff, I will.' Alisha was found dead clutching her teddy bear and surrounded by notes to her loved ones in February 2018, after struggling with 'violent mood swings'. Prosecutors accuse Kusi of grooming and sexually abusing a different patient, including two counts of oral sex she claims to have performed with him. Kusi, who is suspected of demanding that the female patient perform a sex act on him after she self-harmed, denies the allegations. His defence lawyers claim the woman fabricated the complaints in a fit of jealously about a perceived relationship between Kusi and Alisha. The complainant, who cannot be named, admitted to being jealous, but denied making up the claims. She responded:'To be honest, I was jealous about the relationship that he was having with Alisha, because obviously I had spent a few weeks with Eric and now it looked like he was transferring his affections. 'First, he was spending a lot of time with me and having this sexual relationship and then Alisha came in and it was like he was spending all his time with Alisha and he would only come to me if he wanted something sexual. 'In my life, I was craving to have the love that Eric showed me and then for him to be with another girl, I was jealous and it did upset me quite a lot.' Kusi was also accused of messaging Alisha and telling both female patients that he wanted to have children with them, the court heard. Defending, Michael Harrison told the teenager: 'None of those acts of sexualyou have described took place. You made this up to get him [Kusi] into trouble because you were jealous of him starting a relationship with Alisha.' The complainant replied: 'That is absolute lies. It did take place.I had no reason to get him into trouble. He should not have been having any relationship with Alisha at all and the relationship is the same one he was having with me. 'Yes, I was jealous, but I have not made this up.' The jury heard how the complainant had a history of self-harm, including cutting and scratching herself, and banging her head against walls. The case continues. For support, call the Samaritans on 116123 or go to www.samaritans.org.",0
11,"You probably know that psychologists divide people into different personality types. But did you know you also have a sexual personality? Clinical psychologist Dr Britney Blair, from Stanford University School of Medicine, in the U.S., says we all fall into one of 12 categories — for instance, you might be the Adventurer or the Muse. Dr Blair has drawn on more than a decade of clinical experience to create her dozen types, and says learning yours could help you understand your preferences — and problems — in the bedroom, and ultimately transform your sex life. ‘Just like your general personality, your sexual personality is a mixture of nature and nurture, developing partly from the traits you are born with combined with the experiences you have, and cultural and religious influences,’ she says. Her new sexual personality test is available through an app, Lover, which launches this week. It is based on the methodology of the respected Myers-Briggs personality test, which sorts people into 16 groups and is routinely used in offices to help employers understand and motivate their workforce. Dr Blair says you can use her 12 categories to make a profound difference to the way you communicate with your partner. The most popular profile types for women are the Sovereign, the Adventurer and the Sensualist. But in the UK, the most common profile is the Muse — a charismatic lover who tends to be better at receiving than giving in bed — and it’s men who are more likely to fall into this category. ‘Couples often fight about differences in their sexual personalities that are preventing their needs being met. But if you and your partner have very different profiles, it doesn’t mean you’re incompatible — you just have different strengths and need to work on these together,’ says Dr Blair. ‘I’ve been working in sexual health for over a decade and I have never worked with a couple who have the same amount of sexual desire. There is always a discrepancy.’ She adds: ‘Women are also more hardwired for novelty than men, so their desire can drop in long-term relationships. Knowing your sexual personality can help you learn your own ways of getting aroused, fuel your sexual desire and increase erotic connection with your partner.’ The profiles are based on eight different traits related to sex. For instance, how open are you to new experiences? How sensual are you? Are you more into connection with your partner or physical pleasure?’ The full test relies on a complex online algorithm. But you can get a good idea of your type from reading about the preferences of each category below — then read on for advice on how to boost your sex life. So, for example, if you’re a routine-loving, cerebral Judicious type paired with an adventurous Renegade, you need to learn to compromise. The Renegade must make the Judicious partner feel safe, and the latter must ensure that the Renegade feels accepted, not judged, for their desires. ‘Understanding both your profile and your partner’s can help decrease feelings of shame or guilt,’ says Dr Blair. ‘Maybe you prefer a little more emotional intimacy before you feel sexual, and maybe your partner wants to jump into erotic touch just for the sake of experiencing pleasure.’ Read on to discover which sexual personality type fits you best — and how to use it to spice up your sex life... The Renegade This is you if: You’re turned on by sex in unusual places and quickly get bored of a routine. About you: You like your sex spontaneous and are open to non-conventional partnerships and experiences. For you, pleasure comes first. Confident in the bedroom, you are an intense lover and like to try new things. How to boost your sex life: As a thrill-seeker, you may find yourself prioritising pleasure over a deeper connection. Try taking a moment before acting when it comes to sex. Consider the long-term outcome. The Altruist This is you if: You prefer giving pleasure — and seeing your partner’s response — to receiving it. About you: You are a classic ‘giver’. You consider your own orgasm secondary to your partner’s, so you have probably developed a strong sexual skill set. ‘To you, nothing is hotter than seeing your partner lost in the throes of passion. And if something isn’t quite clicking, you are quick to adjust and not afraid to explore the unconventional,’ says Dr Blair. You want a deep connection and appreciate that it’s about more than the physical: mutual devotion and commitment matter, too. How to boost your sex life: You can be a chameleon, taking on the same preferences as your partner. But it’s important to bring your own desires to the table. Listen to your body as much as your head. Masturbation can be a powerful tool to help work out what you want. The Adventurer This is you if: You enjoy intense sex with your partner but would feel nervous about casual sex. About you: Bold and experimental, you like to try new things — especially when you are in a relationship. It’s important that sex remains meaningful. ‘For you, sex is a bonding experience,’ says Dr Blair. ‘For a long-term partnership to thrive, you need both wild sex and a deep emotional connection.’ How to boost your sex life: Realise you are prone to boredom in a long-term relationship. Admit it and seek imaginative solutions, which might include spicing things up with role-play or sex toys. The Judicious This is you if: You enjoy phone sex to connect with your partner when you are away from home, but wouldn’t dream of having a one-night stand. About you: You crave comfort, and need to feel close to your partner to enjoy sex. But under the right conditions you can be seductive and sensuous. You quickly opt out of relationships if you sense the other person isn’t in it for the long haul. Some might call you picky. How to boost your sex life: Try not to be too cautious. Don’t let your fear of rejection or judgment hold you back in bed. Make time for yourself and explore your own desires and fantasies. Learn to ask for what you want with lovers, as your partner may be missing your non-verbal cues. The Romantic This is you if: You like being wooed with chocolates, hearts and flowers but find talk of racy sex shocking. About you: Sex, for you, is so much more than the physical act. You use it to deepen your bond with a lover. According to Dr Blair: ‘You’re turned on by classic romance — date nights and walks in the park — and you want to feel the love, with deep eye contact during sex.’ Being reserved, it can take you time to find a partner you feel safe with. You never want your lover to feel like a sexual object, so you take care to make them feel appreciated. And when you do fall, you tend to fall hard. How to boost your sex life: Don’t feel pressured to rush things — but when you do commit, don’t let your love of routine stop you trying something new. Experiment with new sexual positions or erotica to gently spice things up. Learn what feels good for you. The Scholar This is you if: You like to be seduced and avoid taking risks. About you: Naturally reserved, you are an attentive lover who is happiest in a loving relationship. ‘You won’t jump into bed with just anyone,’ says Dr Blair. You are well balanced sexually, enjoying receiving pleasure as well as giving your partner what they want. You enjoy being coached and guided in sex and rarely take the initiative. You would rather take on the role of ‘learner’ to an experienced partner. How to boost your sex life: Your natural tendency is to shy away from new sexual activities as risky, but sometimes it’s good to try new things. You tend to be on the quiet side during sex and may not articulate your desires clearly. Try speaking up and ask your partner what they want, too. The Charmer This is you if: You flirt with everyone and get bored waiting too long for sex with a new partner. About you: You are free-spirited, fun and friendly. Highly skilled in seduction, you are free of judgment, leading you to pursue sexy experiences with new or even multiple partners. You are lucky that you don’t care what others think of you. You are energetic and love gratification, making you a magnanimous sexual being. How to boost your sex life: You find date nights dull and want to fast-forward to the bedroom, which means you sometimes act before you think. Try to use your judgment to assess situations and people. Are you really enjoying yourself with that new person, or just responding to boredom? The Philosopher This is you if: You get a thrill from reading erotica but only enjoy sex if there is a mental connection. About you: You are highly cerebral, with a creative imagination, and your mind is a key sexual organ for you. You don’t have to wait for a partner to enjoy it, either; you can enjoy yourself solo with ease. You are probably already conscious of your own desires. You harness your imagination to push boundaries in the bedroom. ‘You seek out novelty and adventure in your mind,’ says Dr Blair. ‘The downside is that you can be reserved and often need time before exploring that with another person.’ How to boost your sex life: Try to move out of your mind and into your physical body. Practising mindfulness can help. Novelty is great, but make sure you devote time to building an emotional connection with your partner, too. The Ardent This is you if: You have no time for flings that are going nowhere, and like taking care of your partner. About you: Loyal and patient, you know what you want romantically and will make your partner feel safe and connected. ‘Ardents tend to prefer sex within the safety of a serious relationship,’ says Dr Blair. ‘They are often introverts.’ Falling in love and staying in love is a big part of your sexual experience. It’s the relationship that turns you on. But because you are a clear communicator, never afraid to talk about sex, your partner will always know where they stand. How to boost your sex life: Stop overthinking sex. Close your eyes and notice the sensations you feel when you are touching or pleasuring a partner. Tune in to your body’s reactions to sexual stimuli. The Muse This is you if: You get turned on by being admired, but quickly tire of any ‘unnecessary’ pillow talk. About you: Nothing excites you more than experiencing your own pleasure. For you, intimacy and connection are about receiving. You are charismatic, emanating a high sexual energy. You are expressive with body language and eye contact, and use gestures rather than words. You know what will, and won’t, work for you. You want to be worshipped and like to be caressed and kissed, so you need a partner who is willing to do most of the giving in bed and is receptive to your direction. How to boost your sex life: Try not to forget that your partner also has needs. Creating and witnessing sexual arousal in a partner is one of the strongest turn-ons there is, so don’t miss out. Take a step back and think about what turns you on — analyse it as well as enjoy it. The Sovereign This is you if: You like power play in the bedroom — as long as you’re in charge. You find it hard to let go and give in to your feelings. About you: The Sovereign is a sexual powerhouse. ‘You like to be in control of when, and how, sex happens. You’re a master of giving pleasure and a confident lover. You guide your partner into the erotic and help them explore their sexual potential.’ How to boost your sex life: Remember to let your partner take charge sometimes, to explore new ways of lovemaking. And try to think less and feel more during sex. Why not consider letting your partner take the lead while you focus on receiving for a change? The Sensualist This is you if: You need instant chemistry to feel aroused but find it hard to talk about your desires. About you: You are a hedonist with a relaxed approach to sex. A ‘feeler’, you trust your gut and sex is an important part of your life. You are skilful at using body language and exploring your senses. You enjoy massages, cuddling, kissing and being caressed. How to boost your sex life: At times you may get lost in the moment at the cost of your partner’s pleasure. Try refocusing on them occasionally — learn what turns them on. Not everyone is as good at body language as you, so try to communicate your desires verbally too. Don’t expect them to read your mind. And let your lover introduce you to new things. The full profiler is available via a new app for couples called Lover. The basic version is free, while a premium subscription costs £7.99 a month from the App Store (search for ‘Lover sex’).",0
12,"Quantum computers and higher resolution sensors are a step closer after scientists developed a way to control a single atom with an electric field for the first time. Described by the engineering team from UNSW as a 'happy accident', the discovery could replace the tried and tested magnetic resonance imaging used in medicine. It also has 'major implications' for quantum computing as being able to control a single atom with an electric field gives engineers 'much more precision'. Generating magnetic fields, the previous solution, required large coils and high currents but electric fields can be produced on the top of a tiny electrode. Lead author Andrea Morello says this will make it easier to control single atoms and place them in nanoelectric devices such as quantum computers and sensors. Scroll down for video 'This discovery means that we now have a pathway to build quantum computers using single-atom spins without the need for any oscillating magnetic field for their operation,' said Morello. This means that instead of having bulky magnets spinning fast to generate the field required to place the single atoms, they can use a simple electric field. 'Moreover, we can use these nuclei as exquisitely precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields, or to answer fundamental questions in quantum science.' The discovery shakes up the paradigm of nuclear magnetic resonance, according to Morello, who said it could cover everything from medicine to mining. The researchers had originally set out to perform nuclear magnetic resonance on a single atom of antimony - an element that possesses a large nuclear spin. 'Our original goal was to explore the boundary between the quantum world and the classical world, set by the chaotic behaviour of the nuclear spin,' said one of the lead authors of the work, Dr Serwan Asaad. 'This was purely a curiosity-driven project, with no application in mind,' he said. Once they started the experiment they realised 'something was wrong' and that the nuclear behaved very strangely and refused to respond to certain frequencies but show a strong response to others. They discovered they had fabricated a device containing an antimony atom and a special antenna, optimised to create a high-frequency magnetic field to control the nucleus of the atom. Their experiment demands this magnetic field to be quite strong, so they applied a lot of power to the antenna, and we blew it up. 'This puzzled us for a while, until we had a 'eureka moment' and realised that we were doing electric resonance instead of magnetic resonance,' said Dr Vincent Mourik, also a lead author on the paper. 'With the antimony nucleus, the experiment continued to work. It turns out that after the damage, the antenna was creating a strong electric field instead of a magnetic field. So we 'rediscovered' nuclear electric resonance.' 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most widespread techniques in modern physics, chemistry, and even medicine or mining,' says Morello. 'Doctors use it to see inside a patient's body in great detail while mining companies use it to analyse rock samples. 'This all works extremely well, but for certain applications, the need to use magnetic fields to control and detect the nuclei can be a disadvantage.' He used the analogy of a billiard table to explain the difference between controlling nuclear spins with magnetic and electric fields. 'Performing magnetic resonance is like trying to move a particular ball on a billiard table by lifting and shaking the whole table,' he says. 'We'll move the intended ball, but we'll also move all the others.' 'The breakthrough of electric resonance is like being handed an actual billiards stick to hit the ball exactly where you want it.' The idea of controlling a single atom with an electric field isn't a new one - it was first posed as a thought experiment in 1961 by Nobel Laureate Nicolaas Bloembergen. A magnet is any object that has a magnetic field. It attracts ferrous objects like pieces of iron, steel, nickel and cobalt. These days magnets are made artificially in various shapes and sizes depending on their use. One of the most common magnets - the bar magnet - is a long, rectangular bar of uniform cross-section that attracts pieces of ferrous objects. A magnetic field is the space surrounding a magnet, in which magnetic force is exerted. If a bar magnet is placed in such a field, it will experience magnetic forces. However, the field will continue to exist even if the magnet is removed. The direction of magnetic field at a point is the direction of the resultant force acting on a hypothetical North Pole placed at that point. When current flows in a wire, a magnetic field is created around the wire. From this it has been inferred that magnetic fields are produced by the motion of electrical charges. A magnetic field of a bar magnet thus results from the motion of negatively charged electrons in the magnet. The puzzle stood unsolved until Morello and his team 'accidentally' realised what they had achieved in their lab. 'I have worked on spin resonance for 20 years of my life, but honestly, I had never heard of this idea of nuclear electric resonance,' he said. 'We 'rediscovered' this effect by complete accident - it would never have occurred to me to look for it. 'The field of nuclear electric resonance has been almost dormant for more than half a century, after the first attempts to demonstrate it proved too challenging.' After demonstrating the ability to control the nucleus with electric fields, the researchers used sophisticated computer modelling to understand how exactly the electric field influences the spin of the nucleus. This effort highlighted that nuclear electric resonance is a truly local, microscopic phenomenon: the electric field distorts the atomic bonds around the nucleus, causing it to reorient itself. 'This result will open up a treasure trove of discoveries,' says Morello. 'The system we created has enough complexity to study how the classical world we experience every day emerges from the quantum realm. 'Moreover, we can use its quantum complexity to build sensors of electromagnetic fields with vastly improved sensitivity. 'All this, in a simple electronic device made in silicon, controlled with small voltages applied to a metal electrode!' The research has been published in the journal Nature. The key to a quantum computer is its ability to operate on the basis of a circuit not only being 'on' or 'off', but occupying a state that is both 'on' and 'off' at the same time. While this may seem strange, it's down tothe laws of quantum mechanics, which govern the behaviour of the particles which make up an atom. At this micro scale, matter acts in ways that would be impossible at the macro scale of the universe we live in. Quantum mechanics allows these extremely small particles to exist in multiple states, known as 'superposition', until they are either seen or interfered with. A good analogy is that of a coin spinning in the air. It cannot be said to be either a 'heads' or 'tails' until it lands. The heart of modern computing is binary code, which has served computers for decades. While a classical computer has 'bits' made up of zeros and ones, a quantum computer has 'qubits' which can take on the value of zero or one, or even both simultaneously. One of the major stumbling blocks for the development of quantum computers has been demonstrating they can beat classical computers. Google,IBM, and Intel are among companies competing to achieve this. ",0
13,"Beverley Turner can pinpoint the exact moment she realised her tumultuous 17-year marriage to Olympian James Cracknell was finally over. He was packing up the car to drive off to Cambridge University to start an MA — head full of dreams of winning the Boat Race — while she dried up pots in the kitchen of their home in Chiswick, West London. Another exciting new chapter was opening up for him as he chased yet another fresh challenge, while she — once again — was left at home to hold the fort with their three young children. ‘I was standing on the doorstep, waving goodbye and it felt a bit like your teenage son going off to university,’ says Beverley of that day in 2018. ‘There was an element of intense sadness, but I think I already knew there probably wasn’t any coming back from it or all the trauma that we’d been through. ‘I’d tried to talk to him multiple times about what it would mean to be away from the family so much, but he had his blinkers on. ‘When an Olympic gold medallist has something in their sights, nothing stands in their way. In his mind, I think he felt he didn’t have any option. ‘Throughout our marriage, for James, it had always been a case of “What next? What next?”. He’d felt a bit lost and this was another goal to aim for. ‘I don’t think either of us was ready to acknowledge at the time that this was the unofficial end, but the fact I didn’t put my foot down tells you where we were in the relationship. ‘If it had been great, he wouldn’t have been going. It was make or break, and it proved to be the latter.’ This is Beverley’s first interview since the couple announced they were divorcing last year. The decree absolute has yet to be granted. Indeed, the Boat Race was the final straw for Beverley who had nursed James, 47, back to health after the horrific road accident ten years ago which left him with life-changing brain injuries. Hit by the wing mirror of a truck as he cycled across America — on one of his many sporting challenges — her husband, doctors warned Beverley, would be on ‘Planet James’ for a while because of damage to the frontal lobe of his brain. It was a devastating blow for the national hero who’d won gold twice rowing for Britain in the coxless fours — Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004 — and then gone on to row the Atlantic, and race to the South Pole. Overnight, Beverley went from being a wife with a sparky, exciting, if exhausting, marriage to a sportsman in his prime, to something closer to a mother, as James struggled to recover. The brain injuries caused him memory problems, difficulties controlling his emotions, issues with decision-making and exacerbated all the driven, almost selfish, single-minded traits required to become an Olympian. By his own admission, he became even more determined to prove himself a second time round, at the expense of his family life. At times, it felt to Beverley like she had another child to manage. ‘I had one husband for eight years and another husband for the next eight years. After the accident, he was not the man I married and it changed the whole dynamic. ‘I became much more maternal, which wasn’t healthy, and it brought out the worst in both of us. But I think we did a really good job of toughing it out for as long as we did,’ says Beverley, who was pregnant with their youngest daughter, Trixie, when James was injured. ‘Those first two or three years were truly terrible, with awful peaks and troughs, and it would have been so easy to leave James then, but I loved him enormously, our children were very young and I felt extremely sorry for him because the accident hadn’t been his fault. ‘The sad thing is we were in a really good place before the accident, and I consider it one of our greatest achievements that we managed to struggle on for another eight years. We both have a lot to be proud of, but the odds were always against us. ‘When I married James, I thought we’d be together for ever, but the divorce statistics for elite sports people is around 75 per cent, and higher again for marriages affected by brain injury, so put those two together, what chance did we have?’ Beverley, a TV and radio broadcaster who also runs a small business called The Happy Birth Club, providing ante-natal courses across three locations in West London, says she was not surprised when she heard ‘on the grapevine’ that James had been seen out dining with attractive young American blonde Jordan Connell, 34, now his partner, a few weeks into his first term at Cambridge. She insists he did not cheat on her. Though they had not yet officially split up, they had long talked about going their separate ways. ‘I knew it would be inevitable because he was this handsome superstar in Cambridge. Our relationship had, effectively, been over for some time, and I was quite realistic that he was going to meet someone new,’ she says. ‘So I asked him, “I believe you are seeing someone?” and he just said, “Yes”. I replied, “OK, cool”, thinking “God, that was quick!” but then, actually, “Good for him.” There was this sense of “Thank God, he’s got someone to keep him company”. ‘James is not very good at being single. It sounds nuts when I say it, but I was genuinely pleased for him.’ Beverley says she’d even be delighted to see James happily remarried. ‘I met Jordan for the first time last year, just before James did Strictly, and we talked for two hours over coffee and I came away feeling as if a weight had been lifted,’ she says. ‘I didn’t realise until then just how much I still worried about him, and I felt I could now hand the baton over to this lovely woman who was smart, capable and competent. ‘He is now her responsibility and I feel I can let go. If there’s ever another call to say James is in A&E, I’d be happy for her to go.’ Beverley’s lack of bitterness over James’s new girlfriend is perhaps down to the fact that she, too, now has a new partner, eco property developer James Pritchett, who, at 32, is 14 years her junior. ‘I had such judgment about age-gap relationships before this,’ she says. ‘I would look at an older man with a younger woman and roll my eyes, but now I can completely see what they were doing. I cannot see any disadvantage to it. James P is 32 — a great age for a bloke!’ At 46, Beverley certainly looks as if she has her va va voom back, and then some. Hair glossy and skin all youthful glow, the sparkle is most definitely back in those eyes. ‘That’s what having a 32-year-old boyfriend does for you,’ she laughs, though the actual words she uses are, well, a bit fruitier than that. Say no more, but Beverley can’t help but list his other, seemingly endless qualities. ‘He is full of empathy and kindness. He puts me first in a way that I am just not used to. He’s an amazing listener, thoughtful and generous with a lovely calmness. ‘He thinks I am wise and capable, which is lovely, and he is just the best company, whether we are sitting on the sofa, going for a walk or going out clubbing and getting drunk together.’ They were introduced through mutual acquaintances shortly after her husband left for Cambridge. ‘I needed some help with a property we own in Devon. I had a planning permission issue and was talking to friends who said they knew someone who could help and gave me a number of a guy named James. ‘I spoke to him and thought, “You don’t sound like the hairy builder I was expecting to talk to,” and he came round and there was this very handsome young man on the doorstep. ‘I didn’t for a second think he’d be interested in me, and it turned out he was absolutely useless on the planning issue, but he just started helping me with some stuff that needed doing round the house. ‘It was after Christmas that I realised he was interested in me and, believe me, as a 46-year-old mother of three that comes as quite a shock. ‘He spoke to my son Croyde and said, “I think I would like to take your mummy on a date. Would you mind?” And Croyde said, “Yes, that would be really nice. I didn’t think I’d want anybody to go out with Mummy, but as it’s you . . .” The Cracknells’ children Croyde, 16, Kiki, ten, and Trixie, eight, are thriving and get on well with both new partners. ‘It’s all very grown up,’ she says. So it came as a bit of a bombshell for Beverley to read the less than flattering interview James Cracknell gave to OK! magazine last week. ‘Bev was always viewing me through the prism of a brain injury and she stuck by how I was five or six years ago, rather than how I am now,’ he said of their break-up. Of his new partner Jordan, a financier from New York, he added: ‘It’s nice to have a fresh start and to have someone with a totally fresh perspective.’ He even hinted that re-marriage might be on the cards in the future and possibly more children. ‘It depends how serious it gets. She might want to have children and it would be unfair for her not to,’ he said. As for co-parenting with Beverley, he revealed there wasn’t enough room in the rented flat he shares with Jordan in Chelsea, so he ends up ‘babysitting’ at the old marital home in Chiswick, ‘which is not exactly what I had in mind at my age.’ Beverley sighs and shrugs. Theirs has always been one of those very rare celebrity marriages where both sides have been disarmingly honest about their struggles. Last April, the day after James became the oldest rower ever to win the Boat Race, Beverley wrote about the disintegration of their marriage, describing how she would scream in the shower with despair so their children would not hear. Of his latest feat, she dismissed as ‘b******s’ James’s stated desire to show his children ‘you can do anything you set your mind to’. She countered: ‘I wouldn’t want my children to view such an exit from familial responsibilities as something to aspire to.’ So, Beverley accepts, she can hardly complain when her ex speaks as bluntly as she does. ‘It was typical James, candid and very honest but perhaps a bit tongue-in-cheek, and I’m fine with it,’ she says. ‘He acknowledged that I am a good mum and that the kids are lucky to have me, which is what matters most because they are central to my life and every decision I make. ‘I think the nature of brain injury is that it can be very hard for those who have been injured to see the changes in themselves, to have that insight, but it’s true to say that the James I was married to for the last eight years of our relationship was a very different man to the one I married, and that affected how I related to him.’ What stings most, however, is James’s suggestion that he has been reduced to a babysitting role. ‘He is a very busy man, so of course I have the children the majority of the time, but it’s been that way throughout our marriage, so nothing much has changed,’ she says. ‘The children love their dad and, of course, they want to see more of him and I suppose some people might find it unusual that he comes here to babysit, but it’s about putting the children first. ‘When he stays overnight, he’ll sleep in my bed, while I go to stay with my new partner James, or visit my mum or go to a friend’s house. I try to do that once a week or every two weeks, because when you are a single mum, you need a respite. I can cope with it, but it’s important to have those evenings to myself as well. ‘Of course, it would have been better to stay married, but we are where we are, and I am enjoying rediscovering the woman I was before marriage and children. ‘When I was younger, I had the skill set I needed in James C. He was ambitious — that’s very attractive — he was very successful, very focused, very driven and that’s a real aphrodisiac. ‘But, of course, those qualities that make you incredible as a sportsman, can make you very difficult to live with, especially when children come along. ‘If you are selfish by nature, which you have to be to win gold medals, that selfishness does not lend itself to being a particularly hands-on dad. ‘I don’t think James’s goals will ever evaporate. There will always be something else. Another marathon, another mountain to climb, another ocean to row. That makes for a very exciting life, but an exhausting one.’ Beverley will be appearing on The Daily Show on Mail Plus today.",0
14,"RAF jets were scrambled to intercept Russian bombers in airspace above the Shetland Islands this morning. The RAF confirmed British QRA Typhoons with Voyager support from Lossiemouth were deployed to shadow the aircraft. An unnamed RAF quick reaction alert pilot from RAF Lossiemouth, who intercepted the Russian Bears, said: 'The UK has some of the busiest airspace in the world and civilian airliners are constantly using the airways in this area, so our presence ensured UK air traffic controllers could continue to manage this busy airspace around the hazard of the Russian activity.' Flight tacking data showed an RAF Voyage tanker plane heading north. This comes after six RAF fighter jets were scrambled to intercept Russian bombers on Saturday after they tried to enter British airspace. The Typhoon FGR4 provides the RAF with a highly capable and extremely agile multi-role combat aircraft, capable of being deployed in the full spectrum of air operations, including air policing, peace support and high intensity conflict. Engines: 2 Eurojet EJ200 turbojets Thrust: 20,000lbs each Max speed: 1.8Mach Length: 15.96m Max altitude: 55,000ft Span: 11.09m Aircrew: 1 Armament: Paveway IV, AMRAAM, ASRAAM, Mauser 27mm Cannon, Enhanced Paveway II An undisclosed number of Tupolev Tu-95 Bears, Russian aircraft used as strategic bombers and maritime patrol planes, headed towards northwest Scotland. The RAF deployed two pairs of Typhoons from RAF Lossiemouth near Moray and a third pair from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to force them to change course. A Voyager tanker was also deployed from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Last April, Typhoons from RAF Lossiemouth were scrambled twice in five days to prevent Russian military planes entering UK airspace. In the same period, jets from RAF Coningsby were also deployed to a separate incident involving Russian aircraft. All these incidents come amid heightened tensions between London and Moscow, after Russian GRU agents used chemical weapons in Salisbury in 2018.",0
15,"A bitter mum has been found guilty of trying to have her ex husband killed so she could win back custody of their daughter. Victoria Breeden tried to persuade three different men to murder Rob Parkes after their relationship broke down and he won custody of their daughter.  The “bitter and angry” 39-year-old offered one of the men £5,000 to kill Mr Parkes. A jury at Chelmsford Crown Court unanimously found Breeden guilty on three counts of soliciting to murder Mr Parkes between 2014 and 2019. Christopher Paxton QC had told the jury Breeden’s determination to carry out the attacks was borne out of a desire to get revenge on Mr Parkes after he won custody of their teenage daughterfollowing the breakdown of their marriage. He said: 'The defendant had both the motive and means to solicit others to killer or murder Mr Parkes on her behalf. 'It is through good fortune along that her plans have not been fulfilled. 'The defendant was in a relationship with some of the men who she sought to help her with this deadly plan, others were just friends. 'These were not empty words she spoke in a pique of temper, she had the financial means to fund her plan. 'Each of the solicitations to murder had or concerned one target and that was her ex husband.' Breeden, who uses a wheelchair, was cleared on a fourth count of plotting to kill her former partner. On one occasion she was recorded discussing the prospect of arranging a killer to take Mr Parkes' life. Mr Paxton told the court: 'It is through good fortune that her plans have not been fulfilled. 'The defendant was in a relationship with some of the men who she sought to help her with this deadly plan, others were just friends. 'These were not empty words she spoke in a pique of temper, she had the financial means to fund her plan. 'Each of the solicitations to murder had or concerned one target and that was her ex husband.' Breeden and her ex husband met at university in 1999 before marrying in 2004. Their marriage broke down between 2006 and 2008 and in 2014 Mr Parkes won custody of the couple’s only child, the jury heard. Mr Paxton told the jury the loss of the court case appeared to cause 'bitterness and anger' in Breeden, who has two more children from other relationships. He said: 'This drove her, or drove her in part to seek retribution against Mr Parkes. 'The fact that he lived does not mean the defendant was not serious in what she sought to do.' Breeden first asked a friend Hamish Martin, to ‘sort out’ her ex husband, whom she described as 'a b******'. Mr Paxton said: 'She said she could get together £5,000 if he knew someone who could do it for her.' Breeden repeatedly asked him about arranging something and he then had to tell her he did not want to have any more conversations about the matter. In October 2018 Breeden asked her then partner, Graham Wall, to help to arrange to kill Mr Parkes, describing her ex as a 'dangerous, deceitful and influential,' man. She told him that with Mr Parkes 'gone', she would have access to her daughter again. 'If you can’t do that, then you are of no use to me', she told him. Mr Paxton added: 'Mr Wall believed that if he had said ‘yes’ the defendant would have gone through with it.' Last year Breeden asked a third man called Earl Gernon to kill Mr Parkes. Mr Wall captured the alleged instructions in a mobile phone recording he made because he was suspicious that Breeden was cheating on him with Mr Gernon. She did not name her ex hubby to Mr Gernon who did discuss what details would be required in order for an attack to take place. Breeden, of Littleport, Cambridgeshire, has denied four counts of soliciting to murder her ex husband. She was convicted on three counts and cleared on a fourth count. The attempts took place during a five-year period between 2014 and last year. A decision on when sentencing will take place is set to be made this afternoon. Breeden was remanded in custody.",0
16,"Taking half an aspirin pill a day slashes the risk of liver cancer, research suggests. People who take a regular low dose are 43 per cent less likely to develop the disease, Harvard scientists discovered. The drug also cuts death rates from all liver problems – including fatty liver disease – by more than 25 per cent. The findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, are based on an analysis of more than 50,000 people in Sweden with chronic viral hepatitis, the most common risk factor for liver cancer. The participants took a low daily dose of about half a regular-strength tablet – less than 163mg – for pain relief. Over an average follow-up of nearly eight years, 4 per cent of patients developed liver cancer, compared with 8.3 per cent of non-users. Importantly, the longer a person took the drugs, the greater the benefit. Scientists have been exploring whether aspirin may ward off cancer for some time, and experts have already shown that a low dose could also significantly reduce the risk of bowel cancer. ",0
17,"MPs are to investigate the effectiveness of the foreign aid billions spent by Britain. The £14.6billion budget has faced criticism, with questions over the legitimacy of the projects it is used on. During its inquiry, the International Development Committee will consider whether or not the aid makes a real and lasting impact. Labour MP Sarah Champion, the chairman of the committee, said: 'The UK is second only to the US in the amount it spends on aid. 'As one of the few governments around the world that has an independent department of experts with the sole function of delivering aid to those who need it most, it is rightly the envy of many internationally. But we cannot ignore the controversy that has surrounded UK aid for some years, with reports of wasteful spending and a lack of transparency on certain projects. 'We must show global leadership here and reassure British taxpayers that their money is being well spent, and that the system established to help some of the world's poorest people is delivering.' Mrs Champion added: 'During this inquiry, the committee will hear from experts on how the Department for International Development delivers aid and what – if any – are the implications in eroding its independent status. Our report will be published in June.' Earlier this year the Daily Mail revealed how a mosque in Egypt has been rebuilt using British aid as millions of pounds are lavished on arts and culture projects abroad. It was part of overseas development money dished out by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. This more than doubled to £8.9million in 2018, up from £4.2million the previous year. Britain has also increased aid spending in China and India – even as both plan to send missions to the Moon. The countries, which are the two fastest-growing economies in the world, received £150.6million of UK taxpayers' money in 2018. Projects funded included a £1.1million scheme to reduce the amount of salt Chinese people have in their diet. In India, aid money went on mobile phone text alerts to tackle problem drinking and a study into whether yoga can be used to prevent type 2 diabetes. Boris Johnson is under pressure to improve how Britain's aid is used after he pledged at the election to keep David Cameron's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas development. The Prime Minister abandoned plans to merge the Department for International Development into the Foreign Office at last month's reshuffle, although it is thought this could be back on the table as part of a foreign policy review later this year. Britain's foreign aid budget rose £493million to reach £14.6billion for the first time in 2018. The UK was the only G7 nation to hit the 0.7 per cent spending target, giving more than double the 0.29 per cent G7 average. None of the other G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and America – met the spending target. The UK is now fifth in the league table of the 30 countries that are part of the development assistance committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Top is Sweden at 1.04 per cent, followed by other Scandinavian nations. ",0
18,"Harvey Weinstein did not apologize to his victims but said he felt remorse for the men and women in the #MeToo fight before he was sentenced to 23 years in prison for sex crimes in a landmark case that ended with hisaccusers sobbing and hugging each other in court. The 67-year-old, who is in poor health and will not be eligible for parole for 20 years, could potentially spend the rest of his life in prison after his sentence was handed down in Manhattan criminal court on Wednesday. The disgraced Hollywood producer's defense team slammed the punishment as 'obscene' and already vowed to appeal. Weinstein was sentenced to 20 years on the criminal sex act charge for forcibly performing oral sex on production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006.He was sentenced to three years for third degree rape for the attack onJessica Mann in 2013. JudgeJames Burke, who oversaw his trial, ordered Weinstein to serve the sentences consecutively and sentenced him to five years post release supervision for each charge. 'Although this is a first conviction, this is not a first offense,' the judge said before revealing the prison sentence. Weinstein maintained a blank face and did not visibly react. Weinstein, who still faces separate sex crimes charges in Los Angeles, was wheeled out of the court in his wheelchair immediately after and will now be taken to the maximum security Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York. After two of his accusers confronted him in court with their victim impact statements, Weinstein broke his courtroom silence to say he felt 'remorse for this situation' but said he was perplexed by the case and the #MeToo climate in which it unfolded. He offered no apology to his victims.  Remorse, the #MeToo movement and his victims: 'We may have different truths, but I have remorse... For all of you and for all the men and women going through this crisis right now in this country.' 'Thousands of men are losing due process. I'm worried about this country.' 'I'm totally confused. I think men are confused about these issues.' 'The movement basically started with me… now there are thousands of men who are being accused.' He said he had fond memories of his accusers and believed he had a 'serious friendship' with both Mann and Haleyi. 'I'm not going to say these aren't great people. I had wonderful times with these people.' Apology for his ex-wives: 'I went through extraordinary lengths to hide my affairs.' 'They had nothing to do with any of it. I was unfaithful to both and I just can't tell you how bad I feel from that'. Hollywood power and influence: 'I had no great powers in this industry. Miramax, at the height of its fame, was a small firm.' 'That's what it was, but it became blown up - like power, power, power. I wasn't' about power, I was about making great movie.' 'I'm not going to run away from some of the things I did say.' 'Yes, I said bad things to people but there are so many people, thousands of people, who would say great things about me.' Pleading for lighter sentence: 'I really feel remorse for this situation. I feel it deeply in my heart.' 'I'm really trying to be a better person.' 'I haven't seen my three older children since the New York Times (and) the New Yorker articles came out.' 'That for me is hell on earth. I may never see my children again.' 'We may have different truths, but I have remorse...For all of you and for all the men and women going through this crisis right now in this country,' Weinstein said,adding he was worried about 'thousands of men' being denied due process in the #MeToo era. 'I'm totally confused. I think men are confused about these issues,' he said in a calm but creaking voice, adding that he had fond memories of his accusers and believed he had a 'serious friendship' with both Mann and Haleyi. 'I can't stop looking at Jessica and Mimi and hoping something maybe from our old relationship could emerge,' he said. Looking back during the trial at emails he exchanged with his accusers, he said he thought they had a good friendship. 'I'm not going to say these aren't great people. I had wonderful times with these people,' he said. Weinstein had begged for mercy prior to his sentencing, telling the court he had been through 'hell on earth' and was 'really trying to be a better person.' He noted that he hadn't seen his three adult children since the allegations publicly surfaced and that he may never see his two youngest children again. Weinstein acknowledged going to 'extraordinary lengths' to hide the affairs he had from his two ex-wives,Eve Chilton and Georgina Chapman. 'They had nothing to do with any of it. I was unfaithful to both and I just can't tell you how bad I feel from that,' he said. At one point, Weinstein started talking about how he had raised millions of dollars for New York City after Hurricane Sandy and September 11. Once one of Hollywood's most influential producers, Weinstein had faced the possibility of a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison. Weinstein's defense attorney Donna Rotunno slammed the judge and jury outside court, saying the trial was totally unfair and that he 'really never had a fair shake from day one.' 'We were looking for fairness, and we didn't get it,' Rotunno said. Rotunno, who said they would be appealing by July, said the sentence was 'too harsh'. Asked about the impact of the #MeToo movement, Rotunno said: 'This says nothing to me about the #MeToo movement other than the judge felt some type of pressure.' Weinstein was sentenced a week shy of his 68th birthday, and his lawyers argued that a lengthy prison term would, in effect, be a life sentence. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said afterward that the judge 'sent a message today that this type behavior is something that any potential offender is going to have to consider. 'The judge took it seriously, which is exactly how we think he should have. And we're grateful.' Appearing before the media outside court, attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three of the women who testified at Weinstein's trial, waved a piece of paper saying, 'This is what justice looks like, 20 + 3 years.' Mann and Haleyi, who delivered victim impact statements on Wednesday, were joined in court by four of Weinstein's other accusers:Annabella Sciorra, Tarale Wulff, Dawn Dunning and Lauren Marie Young. All six women testified during Weinstein's high-profile trial last month but only Mann and Haleyi were allowed to address the court. Weinstein was taken from the Manhattan courtroom to theDownstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York. The facility is a maximum security prison where inmates from New York City can be held pending a medical evaluation. He will then be transferredto a state prison facility. There are two state prisons in New York - Fishkill andCoxsackie - that havemedical units for inmates. State officials can take into account recommendations from Weinstein's judge given his health problems. Weinstein used a walker throughout the trial and arrived at the courthouse Wednesday in wheelchair because of back problems from a car crash last summer. He has a condition that requires shots in his eyes and last week had a stent placed to unblock an artery. Haleyi, who was the first to deliver her statement, sobbed as she told the court spoke of the trauma she had endured since the attack, addingthat Weinstein crushed her spirit and altered the course of her life. She said the attack on her in Weinstein's Soho apartment in 2006 came at a 'very vulnerable point' in her life. 'He attacked me with physical force, with no regard…It diminished my confidence and faith in people. It was very embarrassing and hurtful,' she said. 'I eventually buried it, I minimized it. .. because that was my coping mechanism.In reality, this incident altered the course of my life.He crushed a part of my spirit. 'It scarred me deeply, mentally and emotionally, perhaps irreparably, perhaps forever.' She said Weinstein has seemed 'completely disconnected from the gravity of the crime he has committed against me'. Haleyi said the attack made her rethink her career in the entertainment business and left her feeling paranoid and afraid of retaliation. She said she avoids dating because she doesn't want to hurt people, have them feel embarrassed or distance themselves when they find out what happened to her. She said that testifying against him was a way of healing given she had spent the past few years living in fear that he would retaliate against her. 'At the time, I thought I was alone in this. I didn't understand the extent of Harvey Weinstein's calculated behavior. The pattern is obvious. I have no doubt if Harvery Weinstein was not convicted by this jury, he would have… again and again. 'I am relieved that there are women out there who are safer because he's not out there.' 'I have never felt vengeful. I just felt sad for myself, I felt sad for everyone he hurt and sad even for him for having done this to himself.' Mann, in her statement, said she wanted to remind the court that she told Weinstein 'no' and that shewished she'd been able to fight him off when he raped her in a Manhattan hotel. 'I am forced to carry that experience until I die,' she said. 'It takes a very special kind of evil to exploit connections to leverage rape. 'Rape is not just one moment of penetration. It is forever,' she said, before recalling a moment during the trial when she left the witness stand in tears and then could be heard screaming from an adjacent room. 'The day my screams were heard from the witness room was the day my voice came back to its full power,' she said. Mann said that 12 people found Weinstein guilty of raping her but that he was 'baffled at finally being held accountable' because he still denies any wrongdoing. She addressed the maxiumum four-year sentence Weinstein could face on her charge alone by comparing it drug offenses that could have a 20-year sentence. 'How am I not worth more than cocaine?' Mann said. Mann added that she now wanted to create a future 'where monsters no longer hide in our closets'. Weinstein was convicted on two counts on February 24: A criminal sex act for the 2006 assault on Haleyi and third degree rape for the 2013 attack on Mann. He was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault stemming from actress Annabella Sciorra's allegations of a mid-1990s rape. The other three women who have accused Weinstein of assault were brought in to testify as prosecutors sought to show he had a pattern of behavior. Rosanna Arquette, one of Weinstein's many accusers, led reactions on Wednesday to the news of his 23-year sentence praising the 'brave women' who broke their silence against the rapist and saying he 'got what he deserved...because he raped so many more'. Several of Weinstein's accusers and other Hollywood women and allies took to Twitter to celebrate the disgraced producer's sentence and speak of hope that the verdict will pave the way for greater justice for other victims of sexual assault. Arquette praised the women who had helped put the abuser behind bars and singled out actress Rose McGowan and journalist Ronan Farrow for helping to bring his campaign of sexual assault in Hollywood to an end. 'Gratitude to all the silence breakers especially Rose and all survivors of Weinstein to the brave women who testified and to the incredible investigative reporting of Ronan Farrow who uncovered the sabotage and spying and to David Remnick thank you Rich McKuen and NY times,' she tweeted. Arquette, who was one of the first women to break her silence about the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of Weinstein in the early 1990s, went on to slam the rapist's defense attorney Donna Rotunno. 'Please shut up Donna Rotunno the only obscene and obnoxious person here is you. He got what he deserved because he's a rapist. He is in prison because he raped SO MANY MORE WOMEN and ruined lives and careers there is more evidence and one woman was 16 at the time.' Another accuser, Mira Sorvino, told of how she cried 'tears of amazement' when the sentencing was handed down. Sorvino, who came forward accusing Weinstein of sexually harassing her and then seeking to destroy her career after she dismissed his advances, tweeted: '23 years. Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for his crimes of rape and sexual assault. I literally cried tears of amazement, gratitude that the justice system has worked on behalf of all of his victims today.' The Silence Breakers, a group of 24 of Weinstein's accusers including actresses Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd and Rosanna Arquette, issued a statement following the verdict saying that 'no amount of jail time' will lessen the impact on his victims and that the community will continue to fight to 'have our voices heard'. 'Harvey Weinstein's legacy will always be that he's a convicted rapist. He is going to jail – but no amount of jail time will repair the lives he ruined, the careers he destroyed, or the damage he has caused,' the statement read. 'The Silence Breaker community was founded on solidarity, support, and compassion. The New York trial has ended, but the Silence Breakers will persist in our crusade for cultural change, justice and to have our voices heard.' The Time's UP Foundation tweeted its thanks to the many victims who had spoken out against the powerful media mogul: 'Thank you Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff, and Lauren Young. Thank you to all the #silencebreakers. The social change you've catalyzed is just beginning. We're committed to continuing the fight.' A statement from Tina Tchen, president and CEO of the TIME'S UP Foundation, thanked the 'courage and strength' of the women. 'First and foremost, we are grateful for the courage and strength of Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff, and Lauren Young, who bravely testified in court, and we remain in solidarity with the more than 100 survivors who suffered abuse, harassment, and rape at the hands of Harvey Weinstein. The trauma of sexual assault and harassment is lifelong — we can only hope that today's sentence brings all of the survivors of Harvey Weinstein some measure of peace,' she said. 'We also hope that these women take pride in knowing the impact they have had on our culture at large. Whether by inspiring more survivors to come forward and seek help, changing how the justice system responds to sexual violence, or leading corporate boards to hold more CEOs accountable for toxic workplace culture, the social change catalyzed by these survivors has been nothing short of transformational. 'TIME'S UP is committed to keep fighting until everybody is safe at work and in the pursuit of their careers, no exceptions.' Court documents unsealed a day before Weinstein's sentencing revealed he sought help from billionaires Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg as sexual misconduct allegations against him piled up in October 2017. The documents, which were unsealed by the Manhattan Supreme Court, revealed that board members of the now-shuttered Weinstein Company were looking to fire the producer within days of the initial news reports about his misconduct. In a last-ditch effort to save his job, Weinstein emailed a group of his wealthy friends asking for their help. Recipients included Amazon boss Bezos, former New York City mayor Bloomberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Netflix's chief content officer Theodore A Sarandos Jr, and NBC vice chairman Ronald Meyer. There is no evidence to suggest they responded. 'My board is thinking of firing me,' Weinstein wrote. 'All I'm asking for is, let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counseling whether it be in a facility or somewhere else, and allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance.' The documents also included scathing messages from Weinstein's brother and former business partner Bob Weinstein, who branded him an 'inhuman pathological liar' and said he deserved to go to hell. In an email exchange dated November, 1, 2017 Weinstein's brother Bob wrote:'You deserve a lifetime achievement award for the sheer savagery and immorality and inhumanness, for the acts u have perpetrated. Oh I forgot. They were all consensual. Then what are you in rehab for? Sex addiction. Don't think so. 'U must be being treated for something. I guess sexual predator comes to mind. 'I pray there is a real hell,' he wrote. 'That's where u belong.' In another email exchange with a PR exec working for the company, Weinstein said Jennifer Aniston 'should be killed' after he learnedthat the National Enquirer was planning to run a story accusing him of groping her. The PR exec had emailed Weinstein a note on October 31, 2017 about allegationshe groped Aniston at a premiere event for their movie Derailed in 2005. Weinstein responded to the note by writing: 'Jen Aniston should be killed.' The Enquirer never ended up running the allegations about Aniston, which turned out to be untrue. The court documents also revealedWeinstein planned to open an addiction center run by women in a bid to revive his tattered image. He outlined his idea for the facility in a public statement that he personally drafted in the fall of 2017 after the sexual misconduct allegations first began. Elsewhere in the statement, Weinstein claimed he was 'suicidal' in the wake of the allegations. Thestatement was scrapped by Weinstein's team of PR advisers. Harvey Weinstein's conviction as a rapist brought a poignant end to the spectacular downfall of one of the most powerful men in the entertainment industry. After angrily denying claims that he had forced himself on women since the allegations became public in 2017, Weinstein was convicted on February 24 on two counts:third degree rape and first degree criminal sexual act. They pertain to two incidents: The rape of Jessica Mann in 2013 and him forcibly performing oral sex on Mimi Haleyi in 2006. Weinstein, 67, was born and raised in Queens, New York. He and his brother Bob had a fascination with film and a passion for it. They parlayed it into Miramax, a distribution company named after their parents Miriam and Max, in the 1970s. In the company's infancy, it distributed art-house films and documentaries but it caught the attention of more serious players and in 1993, Disney acquired the company for $80million in a deal that kept Bob and Harvey in leadership positions. From then on, Weinstein and his brother became the men to impress in Hollywood. Their movies, always featuring the most in-demand star and with esteemed directors attached to them, gave him an unprecedented position of power and rich. It also kicked off the years of alleged abuse that led up to the two incidents he was convicted of last month. In private, Weinstein was allegedly forcing himself on actresses who he promised to put in movies. The claims date back to around 1994 - the year Miramax released Pulp Fiction. In 1997, the success reached new heights; Miramax won its first Oscar with The English Patient.Shakespeare in Love was its next hit. When Gwyneth Paltrow won Best Actress for her performance in the movie at the 1999 Oscars, she thanked Weinstein on stage.It was after he'd allegedly made advances on her by suggesting they both get massages when she was 22 and had been offered a role in a screen adaptation of Emma. In 2005, they left Miramax to found The Weinstein Company. By then, Weinstein had divorced his first wife, Eve Chilton, with whom he has three children. The pair tied the knot in 1984 and remained married until 2004. He married fashion designer Georgina Chapman in 2007 with whom he shares two children. While Weinstein continued to dominate the industry, women were secretly talking behind his back about his reputation for being a predator. Some warned each other not to take meetings in hotel rooms if he'd set them.Others had the meeting set for them by their agents and feared retribution or a missed opportunity if they did not attend and subsequently give in to what they say he wanted. The rumors against him gradually gathered speed as he signed agreements with accusers in civil court which meant they could not speak about what had happened under the terms of non-disclosure agreements. On October 5 2017, the wave crested. The New York Times published a story citing multiple women - including actress Ashey Judd - who said Weinstein had either forced himself on them or used his power to get them to have consensual sex with him. The New Yorker also had a piece in the works that was the result of years of investigating by Ronan Farrow. Together, they laid out decades of allegations and triggered the #MeToo movement.Three days later, he was dismissed from The Weinstein Company. He sued them to get access to his emails. Harvey, defiant, denied it all and began sending emails to friends asking for their continued support and trust. His wife, Georgina, announced she was leaving him on October 11, six days after the first stories went public. As more women spoke out against him, others felt compelled to speak out against other powerful men who they feel wronged them. Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow joined a chorus of women accusing him of misconduct or plain abuse. Slowly, the movement picked up and Hollywood followed.In November 2017, the NYPD said it was investigating a 'credible' threat against him. Throughout the 2018 awards season, female actors wore black on the red carpet and proudly pinned buttons with the phrase Time's Up to the their couture garments.Weinstein was expelled by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. Police forces internationally later confirmed they were also investigating claims against him. It was not until May 2018 that Weinstein was charged in New York. He was released on a $1million bond. He fled the city, taking up refuge in a suburb where he is close enough to his children with Chapman to see them. Weinstein was originally charged in May 2018 over two alleged incidents; the 2013 'rape' and a 2004 incident involving Lucia Evans who said he had forced her to perform oral sex on him. The third incident, which he remains charged over, was first revealed in a second indictment in August 2018. The charge relating to Evans' allegation was dropped in October 2018, however, after his lawyer's proved that one of the detectives leading the case had failed to tell prosecutors that a witness doubted her account. The two indictments were eventually consolidated into one and he will face trial over the alleged rape in 2013 and alleged oral sex in 2006. The victims in those incidents were Jessica Mann and Mimi Haleyi. In December, Weinstein settled with some of his accusers for $25million. It is unknown how much he has paid in legal fees, but his fortune of $150million has taken a substantial loss through lawyers' bills, settlements and his divorce from Chapmnan, which was settled privately in January 2018 for eight figures. The trial finally began after more than two years of legal to and fro in January.It lasted a month. Jurors took five days to convict him.",0
19,"Jim Carrey ‘killed off’ Harvey Weinstein in an obituary-style tweet dated 1952-2020 complete with a sketch of the convicted rapist, in a post on Wednesday. The sketch showed the shamed media mogul looking disheveled after his fall from power, as he wassentenced Wednesday morning in Manhattan criminal court to 23 years for sex crimes in his landmark #MeToo trial. The actor's post came as several of Weinstein's accusers and other Hollywood women and allies took to Twitter to celebrate his 23-year sentence and speak of hope that the verdict will pave the way for greater justice for other victims of sexual assault. Rosanna Arquette, one of Weinstein's many accusers, led reactions to the news of his sentence praising the 'brave women' who broke their silence against the rapist and saying he 'got what he deserved...because he raped so many more'. The disgraced Hollywood producer was handed 20 years on the criminal sex act charge for forcibly performing oral sex on production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006. He was sentenced to three years for third degree rape for the attack on Jessica Mann in 2013. Judge James Burke, who oversaw his trial, ordered Weinstein to serve the sentences consecutively and sentenced him to five years post release supervision for each charge. He will not be eligible for parole for at least 20 years, making it highly likely the rapist will die behind bars. Rosanna Arquette praised the women who had helped put the abuser behind bars and singled out Rose McGowan and Ronan Farrow for helping to bring his campaign of sexual assault in Hollywood to an end. She tweeted: 'Gratitude to all the silence breakers especially Rose and all survivors of weinstein to the brave women who testified and to the incredible investigative reporting of Ronan farrow who uncovered the sabotage and spying and to david Remnick thank you Rich McKuen and ny times.' Arquette, who was one of the first women to break her silence about the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of Weinstein in the early 1990s, went on to slam the rapist's defense attorneyDonna Rotunno who had blasted the sentencing as 'obscene'. Arquette told Rotunno to 'shut up' and said he 'got what he deserved... because he raped SO MANY MORE WOMEN'. 'Please Shut up Donna Rotunno the only obscene and obnoxious person here is you. He got what he deserved because he's a rapist. he is in prison because he raped SO MANY MORE WOMEN and ruined lives and careers there is more evidence and one woman was 16 at the time,' Arquette's tweet read. One of the convicted rapist's other accusers Mira Sorvino told how she cried 'tears of amazement' when the sentencing was handed down to her abuser. Sorvino, who came forward accusing Weinstein of sexually harassing her and then seeking to destroy her career after she dismissed his advances, tweeted: '23 years. Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for his crimes of rape and sexual assault. I literally cried tears of amazement, gratitude that the justice system has worked on behalf of all of his victims today.' Ronan Farrow, whose investigative journalism helped expose the Hollywood director, was another to praise the verdict, saying it showed the 'power of people who speak up'. 'A lot of news underlines how hard it is to hold wealthy and connected people accountable. Today’s shows the power of people who speak up, from a position of far less power, at great personal risk,' he tweeted. Farrow continued: 'Today’s outcome in Harvey Weinstein’s New York trial is the result of the decisions of multiple women to come forward to journalists and to prosecutors at great personal cost and risk. Please keep those women in your thoughts today.' The journalist also slammed suggestions by Weinstein that reporting had 'ruined his life', saying that it had given his victims a voice. Padma Lakshmi, who has previously spoken of her own sexual assault at the hands of a powerful man, echoed Farrow's sentiments, praising today as a 'historic day' for women's equality and for 'holding powerful men accountable for their actions'. The Silence Breakers, a group of 24 of Weinstein's accusers including actresses Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd and Rosanna Arquette, issued a statement following the verdict saying that 'no amount of jail time' will lessen the impact on his victims and that the community will continue to fight to 'have our voices heard'. 'Harvey Weinstein's legacy will always be that he's a convicted rapist. He is going to jail – but no amount of jail time will repair the lives he ruined, the careers he destroyed, or the damage he has caused,' the statement read. 'The Silence Breaker community was founded on solidarity, support, and compassion. The New York trial has ended, but the Silence Breakers will persist in our crusade for cultural change, justice and to have our voices heard.' The Time's UP Foundation tweeted its thanks to the many victims who had spoken out against the powerful media mogul: 'Thank you Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff, and Lauren Young. Thank you to all the #silencebreakers. The social change you've catalyzed is just beginning. We're committed to continuing the fight.' A statement from Tina Tchen, president and CEO of the TIME'S UP Foundation, thanked the 'courage and strength' of the women. 'First and foremost, we are grateful for the courage and strength of Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff, and Lauren Young, who bravely testified in court, and we remain in solidarity with the more than 100 survivors who suffered abuse, harassment, and rape at the hands of Harvey Weinstein. The trauma of sexual assault and harassment is lifelong — we can only hope that today's sentence brings all of the survivors of Harvey Weinstein some measure of peace,' she said. 'We also hope that these women take pride in knowing the impact they have had on our culture at large. Whether by inspiring more survivors to come forward and seek help, changing how the justice system responds to sexual violence, or leading corporate boards to hold more CEOs accountable for toxic workplace culture, the social change catalyzed by these survivors has been nothing short of transformational. 'TIME'S UP is committed to keep fighting until everybody is safe at work and in the pursuit of their careers, no exceptions.' Weinstein, who maintained a blank face as his sentence was handed down, was wheeled out of the courtroom following the sentencing as his accusers sobbed and hugged each other. The judge's sentence came after Weinstein made a rambling statement to the court, in which he spoke of remorse not for his victims but for other men, in what appeared to be a final jibe at his victims. 'I feel remorse for all of the men who are going through this fight,' Weinstein told the court. He said he was worried about 'thousands of men' being denied due process in the #MeToo era. In the statement, he also said he was 'confused' and that he believed he had a 'serious friendship' with Mann and Haleyi. His rambling statement, in which he issued no apology for his crimes, came after Jessica Mann and Mimi Haleyi delivered emotional victim impact statements about how Weinstein had affected their lives. Haleyi, who was the first to deliver her statement, sobbed as she told the court of the trauma she had endured since the attack, saying Weinstein crushed her spirit and altered the course of her life. She said the attack on her in Weinstein's Soho apartment in 2006 came at a 'very vulnerable point' in her life. Mann, in her statement, said she wanted to remind the court that she told Weinstein 'no' and that she wished she'd been able to fight him off when he raped her in a Manhattan hotel. 'I am forced to carry that experience until I die,' she said.",0
